Robust technical and traceability systems ensure that our products are responsibly sourced from suppliers whose values are aligned with our own.

If it became apparent that the required improvement is not possible, then a review of the trading relationship would be undertaken.  As a business we use Labour Providers to supply a percentage of our workforce. Each Labour Provider is audited against our own Labour Provider audit standard every 6 months.  Within these audits, the ETI Base Code and controls around Modern Slavery are reviewed.   We always monitor, assess, and mitigate the potential risk areas in our supply chains and have robust systems in place to deal with such risks.
