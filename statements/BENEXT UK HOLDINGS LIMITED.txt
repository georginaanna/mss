Any consent victims have given to their treatment will be irrelevant where they have been coerced, deceived, or provided with payment or benefit to achieve that consent.   This statement is made as part of The Company’s commitment to eliminating the exploitation of people under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It summarises how The Company operates, the policies and processes in place to minimise the possibility of any problems, any risks we have identified, how we monitor them, and how we train our staff.   MODERN SLAVERY STATISTICS                   OUR BUSINESS The Company group was founded in 1998, and we are now one of the top five largest industrial providers in the UK, supplying temporary, contract and permanent workers to companies across the industrial sectors. We offer nationwide coverage through high-street branches, specialist divisions and onsite managed solutions. With a turnover of almost £200 million in 2019, we currently payroll in excess of 12,000 temporary workers each week and cover more than 3 million shifts per year. Following 20 years of independent status, The Company group became a part of the BeNEXT Group Inc in late 2017. BeNEXT is a global human resource and staffing provider with revenues exceeding £500 million. Following the majority-stake acquisition of The Company group, BeNEXT has provided significant investment to enhance the systems, processes, and products offered to our clients to ensure we continue to grow as a market leading recruitment partner.  The sectors believed to be most affected by slavery and human trafficking are construction, agriculture, textile, security, and food processing and packaging, constituting much of The Company’s core business. As a leading recruiter in the UK operating within these key sectors, The Company realise that we are in at the front line of the recruitment process and our position is key to raising awareness of modern slavery and tackling the problem of hidden labour exploitation. The Company are committed to developing and adopting a proactive approach to tackling hidden labour exploitation.  Our clients range from market-leading multinationals through to SMEs and start-ups. All our clients, work seekers, and temporary workers, are known to, and identified by our staff during the client on boarding and candidate registration process as applicable.  This policy is applicable to all offices and operations within The Company structure and footer. MEMBERSHIPS, PARTNERSHIPS, ASSOCIATIONS AND CREDENTIALS In recognition of the responsibility of The Company to our clients, candidates, employees and contractors, it is a fundamental value of The Company that all of its business and other practices be conducted at all times in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates, its officiating bodies and associations. This is demonstrated by being GLAA licence holders (applicable to companies as detailed within the footer), recently having joined the Compliance Intelligence Network CIN, which is a collaboration of Employment Businesses and Agencies within the UK with a shared focus to work together to help tackle modern slavery and assist in the rescue victims, and through our long-standing relationships with the following organisations:  3                                            gap personnel Holdings Limited – CR - 03589208 – GLAA – CAST0004          BeNext UK Holdings Limited – CR – 8044442   gap technical Limited – CR - 5646432                                                                  Quattro Group Holdings Limited – CR 9508069  Quattro Recruitment Limited – CR - 7131120 – GLAA – QUAT0001 Quattro Healthcare Limited – CR – 09389534 global personnel Limited – CR – 11828264    gap personnel (Telford) Limited – 13377649 – GLAA – GAPP0008 -   COMPANY STRUCTURE                                                               4                                            gap personnel Holdings Limited – CR - 03589208 – GLAA – CAST0004          BeNext UK Holdings Limited – CR – 8044442   gap technical Limited – CR - 5646432                                                                  Quattro Group Holdings Limited – CR 9508069  Quattro Recruitment Limited – CR - 7131120 – GLAA – QUAT0001 Quattro Healthcare Limited – CR – 09389534 global personnel Limited – CR – 11828264    gap personnel (Telford) Limited – 13377649 – GLAA – GAPP0008 -   TACKLING MODERN SLAVERY AND HIDDEN LABOUR EXPLOITATION The Company is committed to developing and adopting a proactive approach to prevent, respond to and remediate the risks of modern slavery, forced and debt-bonded labour, human trafficking and hidden exploitation within its workplaces.  Modern slavery is a broad term used to encompass offences that involve one person depriving another person of their liberty, in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.   Forced labour is all work or service that is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.  Debt-bonded labour is where a person’s labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan or service.   Human trafficking is the recruitment and transportation of persons by threat, force, coercion or other abuse of power or vulnerability to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation.  Hidden labour exploitation is action up to and including modern slavery which involves the exploitation of workers and job applicants by internal or external individuals without the sanction or explicit knowledge of the employer or labour provider.  It includes forced labour and human trafficking for labour exploitation; payment for work-finding services and work-related exploitation such as forced use of accommodation.  It is understood that it is often well hidden by the perpetrators with victims, if they perceive of themselves as such, reluctant to come forward.  COMMITMENTS The Company shall: 1. Designate appropriate managers from the internal compliance team to attend “Tackling Hidden Labour Exploitation” training and to have responsibility for developing and operating company procedures relevant to this issue. 2. Accept that job finding fees are a business cost and will not allow these to be paid by job applicants.   3. Not use any individual or organisation to source and supply workers where they:  a. Have not been signed off by the central compliance team following successful completion of The Company Supplier Due Diligence Process b. Do not hold a valid GLAA license, save where a valid exemption of GLAA requirement is approved by the central compliance team c. Have not confirmed that workers are not being charged a work finding fee. 4. Ensure that all staff responsible for directly recruiting workers are trained to be aware of issues around third-party labour exploitation and signs to look for and have signed the appropriate Recruiter Compliance Principles policy document. 5. Ensure that labour sourcing, recruitment and worker placement processes are under the control of trusted and competent staff members. 6. Adopt a proactive approach to reporting suspicions of hidden worker exploitation to the Gangmasters Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) and police. 7. Provide information on tackling “Hidden Labour Exploitation” to our workforce through the sending of Stronger Together leaflets as part of the onboarding process specifically contained within the ‘welcome email’ and displaying the Stronger Together posters in all of our offices and onsite operations.  8. Encourage workers to report cases of hidden third-party labour exploitation, provide the means to do so and investigate and act on reports appropriately. 9. Positively encourage and support employees and agency workers to report such exploitation which may be occurring within their communities by training all internal staff on how to spot the signs of Modern-Day Slavery as part of our internal corporate induction. 10. Require labour providers and other organisations in the labour supply chain to adopt policies and procedures consistent with the above. 11. Endeavor to collaborate with clients and create new partnerships to join together to tackle modern slavery, share intelligence where permitted and strengthen our network to identify, assist and support victims of modern slavery. 12. As part of our commitment to be open and transparent and to report in line with recognised good practice The Company will produce and publish annually a Modern Slavery statement available on our website and gov.uk.  MANAGING RISK We understand that conducting thorough practices and applying due diligence in advance of any engagements we enter into, whether they be with clients, applicants or third-party suppliers, is critical to managing the risk of modern slavery and hidden labour exploitation occurring within our business and/or our supply chains.  Irrelevant of our suppliers’ own policy or process in relation to modern slavery, all external business partners, affiliations and suppliers of The Company are expected to familiarise themselves with our Modern Slavery Statement and associated policies and commitments and operate themselves in a manner which supports our methodology and vision of eliminating the exploitation of people under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and ensuring this does not occur within our supply chain.   DUE DILIGENCE – SUPPLIERS Our supply chain is categorised as High, Medium or Low risk, determined by the nature of the supplier’s business operation.   Suppliers categorised as High Risk are those that have the most direct connection to or involvement with workers such as second tier labour suppliers.  All High-Risk suppliers are required to undergo annual audits, where any issues or cause for concern are identified, further investigation and remedial actions will be taken, and a re-audit scheduled and completed.  Failure to rectify issues identified and/or where the severity of the issues identify are deemed necessary, supplier arrangements will be ceased without notice.  Our full Supplier Due Diligence process will be shared with employees as part of our internal training process and externally with clients and/or suppliers as part of an audit process.  5                                            gap personnel Holdings Limited – CR - 03589208 – GLAA – CAST0004          BeNext UK Holdings Limited – CR – 8044442   gap technical Limited – CR - 5646432                                                                  Quattro Group Holdings Limited – CR 9508069  Quattro Recruitment Limited – CR - 7131120 – GLAA – QUAT0001 Quattro Healthcare Limited – CR – 09389534 global personnel Limited – CR – 11828264    gap personnel (Telford) Limited – 13377649 – GLAA – GAPP0008 -   DUE DILIGENCE – APPLICANTS As a front-line Recruitment Agency, we acknowledge that we are in an ideal position to not only increase applicants’ awareness and understanding of modern slavery, but to ensure through detailed practices that we can identify early on within our recruitment process any potential victims and reduce the exposure of our business to instances of modern slavery. There are a number of measures and procedures that have been implemented into our recruitment process, our full Applicant Onboarding process will be shared with employees as part of our internal training process and externally with clients and/or suppliers as part of an audit process.  Remote exceptions have been implemented throughout the coronavirus pandemic.  These are under constant review and communications updated across our network regularly.    DUE DILIGENCE – WORKER WELFARE The safety and welfare of our workers is paramount to our business principles, as such, the below processes and practices have been designed, developed and implemented with the intention of ensuring our workers’ safety and welfare following placement with The Company and our clients. The below link details the measures and processes in place to effectively manage and monitor the exposure of our workers once placed.  Our full Worker welfare and common details check process will be shared with employees as part of our internal training process and externally with clients and/or suppliers as part of an audit process.

We are very pleased to see the remote processes adopted have not caused any interruption to the companies’ ability and strategies to identify cases suspected to relate to slavery, human trafficking and forced labour and that suspicions have been responded to and supported quickly and effectively.  The biggest change that we encountered in respect of modern slavery was the notable increase of cyber-crime activities being used by criminals falsely representing themselves as part of The Company with the aim of illegally obtaining payment for work and/or work finding services.    2022 MODERN SLAVERY OBJECTIVES The company objectives for 2022 to further strengthen our approach to tackling Modern Slavery include: • Delivery of annual refresher training across The Company network in relation to Modern Slavery, Investigative Interview Techniques, GDPR and Health and Safety. • Appoint a Modern Slavery Champion formally responsible for The Company strategy on Tackling Modern Slavery and hidden labour exploitation. • Host Modern Slavery Seminars for clients to increase awareness and strengthen the safety of workplaces to which our workers are supplied. • Progress Responsible Recruitment Business Partner Status and Advanced Stronger Together Business Partner Status. • Establish relationships with anti-slavery organisations / charities to further strengthen The Company’s knowledge, exposure and continued education on the topic and strategy of tackling modern slavery.   OVERVIEW As a responsible corporate business, The Company aim to act in a socially responsible manner at all times, by respecting the economic, social, cultural, political and civil rights of those employed through our business, and by complying with human rights legislation and the Modern Slavery Act 2015.  Since the publication of our previous Modern Slavery statements, The Company internal Compliance Team have made several changes to their training, systems, audits and standard business practices which have strengthened our operational understanding, awareness and process relating to modern slavery. Additionally, they have developed links with various external bodies and government authorities to ensure industry issues including illegal working prevention and labour exploitation are effectively managed and escalated where required.   We are proud upon publication of our 2022 statement to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the processes we have introduced into our business in relation to tackling modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labour exploitation. The successful identification of several cases of potential exploitation reinforces the dedication and commitment of our teams to tackling modern slavery.  As a business, we are committed to continuous improvement and strive to identify new methods, processes and practices that can be incorporated into our business operations, ensuring the health, safety and welfare of our workforce.
