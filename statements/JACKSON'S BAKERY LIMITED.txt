  Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the Financial Year Ended April 2022  This statement is made in accordance with Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.  It constitutes our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the financial year ended April 2022.  Structure Jacksons Bakery Limited is a subsidiary of William Jackson Food Group, a sixth-generation family business.  Jacksons specialises in baking sliced sandwich bread and supplies most of the major sandwich makers and food service companies in the UK and Europe.  It also makes bread for the Jacksons of Yorkshire Brand and an own label range for a major retailer.  The company started baking from its Derringham Street Bakery in Hull in 1907, and now has 3 manufacturing sites between Hull and Corby, a cold store, and a distribution centre in the Hull area.  Jacksons employs around 400 people and generates an annual turnover of c£100m.  Jacksons sources over 200 different ingredients and food contact packaging items from over 70 suppliers from both the UK and overseas, and sources from additional suppliers for indirect goods and services.  Policy Statement Jacksons is committed to eradicating all instances of modern slavery or human trafficking taking place in any part of our business, or the suppliers we deal with.  This statement reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure no slavery or human trafficking exists anywhere in our supply chains.  Ultimate responsibility for the prevention of modern slavery rests with the business leadership.  The Senior Leadership Team has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy and its implementation comply with our legal, moral, and ethical obligations.  Leaders at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern slavery.  Training and Awareness Jacksons is working with the Stronger Together programme to ensure all relevant colleagues receive the appropriate level of training to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking, and the knowledge to address any related issues which may arise.  We have conducted Stronger Together training for key members of People, Operations, Technical and Procurement functions, and training is also part of our induction process for all colleagues.   We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.  We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains.  Through our training programme and procedures, colleagues have been reminded of the Group Whistle-blowing Policy as the primary method of reporting any suspicions or evidence of slavery or human trafficking.  The Group has also re-publicised the Whistle-blowing Policy in our internal comms to ensure that all our people understand how to safely raise any concerns they may have about possible instances of modern slavery or human trafficking within our own operations or our supply chains.  We will accept and take seriously concerns communicated anonymously.  The business encourages members of the public or people not employed by us to write, in confidence, to the Managing Director or Head of People to raise any concern, issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any part of our business or related supply chain.  Prevention Within Our Business and Supply Chain We will take action to address any evidence of slavery or human trafficking.
