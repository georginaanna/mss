HRF/64 V5  1    MODERN SLAVERY  STATEMENT  July 2022      Produced By: Stacey McFarlane, HR Advisor         HRF/64 V5  2  Our Statement At Aquascot we take our ethical responsibilities seriously and with that strive to continuously improve our practices and corporate input into the fight against Modern Slavery. Our statement provides details of our policies, processes, and actions that we have taken to mitigate the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and across our business operations.  It covers our Modern Slavery Statement for the financial year which ended on 31 January 2022, required under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.   The information within this statement is signed by John Housego, Partner & Managing Director of Aquascot Ltd.   Our Values These set out clearly and earnestly what kind of company Aquascot are proud to be, how we approach new challenges and the qualities we embody in everything we do.  They were shaped and established by our partners' and they reflect both the company we are and the one we will continue to grow into as we continue our employee owned journey. HRF/64 V5  3  Our Highlights of the Year Over the last year, as with all companies in the UK, we have continued to face unprecedented challenges including the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our partners health and wellbeing, and our business operations, coupled with the more recent cost of living crisis. As an employee owned business, we continue to pride ourselves in how our operations and partners continue to face into these challenges and with a sense of togetherness. Some of our highlights over the last year are included below.   Hybrid Working continues to promote a healthy work life balance among our partners. In line with last years launch of our Homeworking policy, which set out our provisions to facilitate effective and efficient homeworking, whilst ensuring the Health & Safety of our partners whilst working at home, and where their role allows, we continue to empower partners to manage their own workload with a flexible onsite/offsite approach. We recognise the continued positive effects on partner wellbeing, welfare, and productivity, and have continued to offer this flexibility.  Full Review of all Family Leave Policies. In line with our business strategy in becoming a great EO company, this year we conducted a full review of all our family leave policies including Maternity, Paternity, Shared Parental Leave, and Adoption Leave. We have since made some significant changes to our partners pay and leave entitlements including paid time of for fertility treatments, providing additional pay to cover a partners’ entire period of maternity/adoption leave, and additional pay and leave support to prospective fathers/partners/spouses.  COVID Resilience Team remains active in the fight against coronavirus and its effects on our partners and operations. Made up of partners across key business areas, our designated team continues to monitor and control our COVID-19 resilience within our daily operations, with further representation now at Board level. Overall, our key focus remains to safeguard our partners health and safety, their employment and income, and our future as a Great EO Company.  Scotland Against Modern Slavery Corporate Partnership. This year as a continued active corporate SAMS partner and as we continue to support the fight against Modern Slavery in seeking to improve our ethical practices, we have continued to utilise the insightful resources on offer, most notably through expanding our knowledge and understanding on the effects and presence of Modern Slavery, the various critical organisations playing a vital role in supporting victims, and what we can do further as an organisation to prevent and support victims of this prevalent crime.    HRF/64 V5  4  Becoming a Real Living Wage Employer. We have recently received our official accreditation in becoming a real living wage employer, with many of our partners benefiting from an increase to their pay. We also continue to apply equal pay to all roles regardless of gender, race, age, or other characteristics.  Our New Volunteering Program. Our first volunteering ‘Beach Clean’ event was held this year in partnership with our sister company SHORE, whom we share a joint passion for our environmental sustainability with. With 20+ partners and their families signing up to help clean our local shoreline, together we cleared over 300kg of waste whilst building relationships through teamwork and collaboration.  Supporting the local community. We have donated a further £2,000 to local charities and community groups in the last year, aiming to support our local community and enhance the lives of those around us. These charities cover key community areas such as mental health, youth development, emergency responders, schools, and hospice care. We are also now proud sponsors of the Alness United U18’s Football Team, supporting the next generation in the Highland Youth League.   Cost of Living Payments to all our Partners. In recognition of the challenging times we are all facing around the current cost of living crisis, we have taken the decision to issue ongoing monthly cost of living payments in addition to standard pay to our partners. The aim being to provide partners with further support and recognition of these challenging times ahead.   Our Young Persons Guarantee. We have recently pledged our commitment to the Scottish Government Program. The scheme is aimed at employers making the commitment to support young persons in the local community through employment opportunities, and teaching new skills such as interview techniques, apprenticeship programmes, and work experience. This was an easy decision for Aquascot as it is a combination of some of our key passions: investing in young people, the local community, and becoming an employer of choice.  Common Language Project. We are proud to have an ethnically diverse workforce, with over 55% of our partners non UK nationals, therefore we continue to seek new ways to build on our values and strengthen our team. With that, we have recently launched the first cohort of fully funded English language classes for partners, teaching speaking, reading, and writing skills.  Our Mental Health First Aiders. This year we have invested in training for a further 6 partners to join the team who continue to provide a vital aid in supporting partners during the ongoing pandemic and cost of living crisis. The aim of our MHFA team is to enhance the support we offer our partners, providing access to confidential, unbiased peer to peer support should they need it. HRF/64 V5  5  Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil Certification. Earlier this year we obtained certification for RSPO, a scheme which is focused on preventing the exploitation of workers, deforestation and destruction of endangered species' habitats. All of our ingredients that contain palm oil or palm kernel oil are now sourced only from suppliers which hold the RSPO-segregated supply chain standard, ensuring the integrity of the palm oil supply chain. Check our progress at: https://rspo.org/members/14701   Leadership Excellence Investment. Within the last year we have rolled out a tailored leadership excellence training program to 30+ partners identified across the business recognised as our future leaders and as an investment in further developing their key leadership skills  including emotional intelligence, aligning personal and organisational values, and better understanding our individual unique qualities and how these can be best applied to our daily operations in line with our values and mission to establish a coaching culture across our business. With two further cohorts scheduled for the coming year we continue to invest in the development of our partners and the positive impact they each have on our future success.   New Waitrose Fish Forum. We have recently joined a newly formed Waitrose Working Group with the ambition and focus on the Responsible Resourcing of migrant workers recruited across both fisheries and aquaculture sectors. We look forward to supporting this initiative and playing an active role in tackling this crucial issue.    Our Business  We supply Waitrose with a wide range of different products, from whole salmon and trout including fillets for the fresh fish counter, to pre-packed 'value added' products.   We are committed to ensuring that our goods are produced without exploitation of others and that our partners, whether directly employed, contracted or agency workers, are treated fairly and honestly, with respect, basic human rights and dignity. We have clear definitions of our values as a business and use these to help drive our behaviour and decision making, and as an Employee-Owned business through our Aquascot Employee Ownership Trust which drives our representation and accountability internally.      HRF/64 V5  6  Our Structure  Our business has four main divisions, Support, Supply, Manufacturing & Commercial. The Senior Managers from each division form our Board & Leadership Team working collaboratively as champions of our values and focusing overall on the success and sustainability of our business, including our ethical trading responsibilities.                           The Partnership Council is a group of partner elected representatives who represent the interests of all our partners, meeting regularly to address new issues and upcoming projects or activities and working closely with the Board & Leadership Team. It holds representation on the Aquascot Board and the Aquascot Trust, with partners elected from the PC as non-executive directors to ensure there is a healthy flow of communication throughout.   The Partnership Council strengthens our purpose as a business and ensures partners are always represented, ensuring the long-term sustainability of Aquascot. HRF/64 V5  7  Our Supply Chain Ethical Trading throughout our supply chain is viewed as a high priority. We are entrusted to ensure high standards of supply chain working conditions, and we need to ensure that we work in collaboration with suppliers, and customers, to meet and exceed these expectations. We work in partnership with our fish supply network conducting 'Responsible Efficient Production Assessments', reviewing worker's rights and well-being on sea farms throughout Scotland. As a specialist supplier to Waitrose we align our ethical standards to be at parity with or exceed their requirements but also work in partnership with them in the development of practical ethical standard improvement across our supply chain and industry.  We are members of Sedex, the Ethical Data Exchange, which is a member organisation for businesses committed to continuous improvement of the ethical performance of both our internal partners as well as our external supply chains.   Our Policies Human Rights Policy  Our Human Rights Policy demonstrates our commitment to the maintenance, evaluation and continuous improvement of standards as set out in National and International laws, the International Labour Organisation conventions as well as our own customers' codes of practice. This policy, structured around the ETI Base Code, addresses key areas such as employment of children and young people, security, working conditions, equality, and health, safety, and welfare standards.  Whistleblowing Policy We are committed to conducting our business with honesty and integrity and we expect all partners to maintain high standards. Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work including bribery, fraud or other criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, health and safety risks, damage to the environment and any breach of legal or professional obligations. We provide all partners with access to our independent, confidential whistleblowing hotline and online reporting system with the additional option to make any report anonymous if a partner wished to do so. Our policy also includes the measures we take to safeguard any whistle-blower ensuring they suffer no detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern.   Equal Opportunities Policy Our policy focuses on promoting equal opportunities in employment. Any job applicants will receive equal treatment regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation (Protected Characteristics). Our policy sets out our approach to equal opportunities and the avoidance of discrimination at work. It HRF/64 V5  8  applies to all aspects of employment with us, including recruitment, pay and conditions, training, appraisals, promotion, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures, and termination of employment.  Anti-Harassment & Bullying Policy We are dedicated to providing a working environment free from harassment and bullying and ensuring all partners are treated, and treat others, with dignity and respect. Our policy covers harassment or bullying which occurs at work and outside of the workplace, such as on business trips or at work-related events or social functions. It covers bullying and harassment by any partner (which may include consultants, contractors, and agency workers) and also by third parties such as customers, suppliers or visitors to our premises.  Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy It is our policy to conduct all business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships.  Our Due Diligence, Risk Assessment & KPI’s As members of Sedex, the Ethical Data Exchange, and as a supplier to Waitrose, we were committed to being externally audited (SMETA) every two years to ensure an independent and transparent monitoring process to receive regular feedback and make continuous improvements since 2016, however this year, with a derogation from Waitrose, alternatively we participated in our second year of running the Waitrose driven Better Jobs Survey initiative. The survey was broken into 7 categories: Voice, Respect, Health & Wellbeing, Reward, Growth, Security, and Job Design, giving our partners a further channel to voice their feedback, ideas, and opinions to highlight what we did well, and where our opportunities are to improve further. In addition, we currently conduct ethical based Self-Assessment Questionnaires on all our farming partners, including their individual farms, with the potential scope to increase this to our wider supplier network (packaging & ingredients) in the future.  Furthermore, as part of the Waitrose Farming Partnership, our Head of Human Resources, and Head of Aquaculture are continuously involved in the ‘Waitrose Ethical Employment and Wellbeing Group’. This provides the opportunity to represent our company in the promotion of our ethical trading strategies, whilst making vital connections with other companies in the same manufacturing sector, gathering evidence-based data and learning of their new innovative approaches to tackling modern slavery and human trafficking.   In addition, we audit our agency labour provider against our Human Rights Policy whilst also ensuring their compliance to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, Modern Slavery Act 2015, and Gangmaster Licensing Standards, including the active measures and steps they are HRF/64 V5  9  taking to promote best practice within their business processes. This audit process also includes independently interviewing a selection of temporary agency workers onsite, covering their personal experiences and their knowledge of the ethical practices and services available that both the agency, and our company have in place.  Our Goals & Objectives As an employee owned business, our partners are at the heart of everything we do, and our goal is to ensure Aquascot continues its journey in Employee Ownership, ensuring all partners have a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment to work in, and opportunities to grow and develop to their full potential.    We are actively ambitious in creating a truly great place to work where our partners are rewarded fairly for the efforts and contributions they make, and where we provide encouragement and treat each other with respect and kindness.   We strongly believe that by applying and communicating our codes of practice and living our values in all that we do, in partnership with our suppliers and customers are taking practical steps towards improving the issues of ethical and responsible sourcing.
