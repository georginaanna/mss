      Müller UK & Ireland Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement Financial Year 2021                  Introduction  Müller is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our business or our supply chains and imposes the same high standards on our suppliers. This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps taken by Müller during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.   Organisation’s structure  Müller’s main trading entities comprise Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP, Muller Service Limited, TM Telford Dairy Limited and Philpot Dairy Products Limited. Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP comprises of three distinct business units: Müller Milk & Ingredients, Müller Yogurt & Desserts and Milk & More. Müller, which has approximately 80 sites in the UK and employs around 7,650 people in the UK & ROI, is part of Unternehmensgruppe Theo Müller (UTM), which is a private owned dairy, deli and services business that was founded  in 1896. The Müller brand first appeared on UK supermarket shelves in 1987.  Our business  Müller Milk & Ingredients aims to be Britain’ private label dairy leader and produces branded and private label fresh milk, cream, butter and ingredients products. It boasts a network of dairies and depots servicing customers throughout the country.   Müller Yogurt & Desserts is the UK’s leading yogurt manufacturer responsible for major brands like Müllerlight, Müller Corner and Müller Rice.   Milk & More delivers daily essentials to approximately 350,000 homes in England, via a network of 47 local fulfilment centres. The milkman is arguably the original home delivery service, and Milk & More is ensuring that this great British tradition continues to flourish. Milk & More has its head office in Camberley.  TM Telford Dairy Limited, which forms part of the Müller Yogurt & Desserts business unit, supplies Müller branded and private label yogurt from a state-of-the-art yogurt facility in Telford, Shropshire.   Philpot Dairy Products Limited, which forms part of the Müller Milk & Ingredients business unit, is a specialised dairy ingredients business, specialising in the supply of high-end dairy ingredients.    Our business and supply chains  In the UK, we work with 1300 farmers and are committed to a sustainable, successful, British dairy industry.  All supplying farms are encouraged to engage with our assessment programme which provides both governance for Müller and improvement advice for our agricultural partners. Our Müller Advantage programme, which was launched in 2020,     incentivises supplying dairy farmers to proactively address a range of important issues for consumers and customers.    Following a review of our end to end UK dairy supply chain in 2021 we have incorporated due diligence questions for our dairy farms within our annual Müller Advantage assessment.  This enables us to identify where temporary labour is being utilised and this highlighted that only 3% of our Müller Direct farmers are using temporary workers to provide support with milking or general farm management.  All of our farms are subject to the Red Tractor standards and are third party assessed. In the 2021 revision of the standards, the section around labour providers was strengthened specifying that  GLAA licenced providers are used, service level agreements are in place and right to work checks are completed prior to commencing employment with individuals.  Within our own businesses we have developed our approach to align with our commitment to the Stronger Together, a multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at tackling modern slavery in  supply chains. The majority of our colleagues are permanently employed by Müller. However, the nature of our business means that in order to respond to peaks in production some temporary staff are required. In such cases we work with GLAA registered providers. We have long standing relationships with our providers, and they have robust onboarding and induction processes. In addition, our HR Team regularly audit our providers to tackle risk of exploitation, with occasional spot checks performed and any non-conformances or concerns followed up in a timely manner.     Our policies   Müller is committed to ensuring there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business or supply chains and this is reflected within company policies. The following policies / codes are in place and approved by the appropriate business units leadership, who are ultimately responsible for our HR strategy and policies:  • Whistleblowing   • Anti-slavery and human trafficking • Anti-bribery and corruption • Supplier code of practice • Grievance • Dignity at Work  Due diligence processes for modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations and supply chain  As part of our processes to identify and mitigate risk as a business:   • The Müller Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy is communicated to all employees across the Müller business, and is accessible to all employees via our intranet. The policy sets out commitments to ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in the business or our supply chains     and sets out an expectation of the same high standards from all contractors, suppliers and other business partners.  • Benchmarking is regularly performed against the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) base code to ensure that the business is acting in accordance with an internationally recognised code of practice.  • All Müller dairies are members of Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) and completes the enhanced SAQ and ethical risk assessment available on the system. • Müller is an AB member of SEDEX, giving better access to risk assessment results and information, through their RADAR tool.  • Every other year the majority of sites are subject to third party ethical audit in line with the Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) process, and the results published on the SEDEX system, along with being shared internally and with our customers. • The standard terms and conditions for the purchase of goods and/or services require suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including, without limitation, those relating to anti-slavery and human trafficking including the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and those relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption including the Bribery Act 2010, and relevant policies.  • All our direct suppliers of ingredients and packaging are required to sign up to a Supplier Code of Practice. To ensure suppliers are compliant with this code, the quality team may perform audits at supplier/production sites.  • In 2021 we strengthened our due diligence process by requesting all suppliers to register on EcoVadis and share their ethical management information. This enables us to have a proactive conversation with our suppliers on how they are mitigating any high risk areas identified.  • We continue to validate the identity of all permanent employees and ensure that they have the legal right to work in the UK.   Training and awareness  The company Learning Management System (LMS) provides access to both mandatory and voluntary training courses on a variety of topics such as legal, operational, financial and ethical training. In particular, our sustainability introduction, ethical trade and ETI base code courses are mandatory for all new employees.  In addition, our HR Managers have attended Stronger Together ‘Modern Slavery in Businesses’ workshops and events.  We recognise that further modern slavery training and awareness is required across other functions within the business, such as our front line managers, procurement, agriculture, quality and HR support teams.    Collaborative Working   We recognise that the issues associated with modern slavery and human rights abuses are global in nature and cannot be tackled in isolation or by one individual business. We therefore work closely with our suppliers, customers, and peers to identify and address any     issues. In demonstrating our commitment to this important topic, in 2021, we became members of the Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET). A UK based initiative made up of primarily UK based suppliers and retailers whose mission is to improve human rights in global food supply chains through a common approach. We will strengthen our relationship with this network and actively participate in relevant workgroups, such as raw material risk assessment and climate change impacts on human rights.   Continuous Improvement Measures  During the next financial year Müller intends to:  • continue to build upon and strengthen our due diligence processes to identify, prioritise, act and monitor modern slavery and human trafficking risks within our businesses and supply chain.  • establish and implement appropriate KPI measures to ensure high standards of compliance are achieved and continuous improvement is delivered. • continue to educate all employees across the Müller business of commitments to eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking in supply chains by providing ongoing support and training where appropriate.  • review our third-party ethical audit processes to ensure it is appropriate to the risk and governance required, with the aim of becoming outcome focussed.  • support our suppliers to develop and implement effective human rights due diligence processes, through engaging initially with EcoVadis and Sedex.  We are pleased to approve this statement for Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP, as the executive leadership team and will ensure that it is reviewed annually.    This statement was approved by the following directors on 29 June 2022.
