This is the Pets at Home Group’s sixthstatementmade under section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act2015 (“Act”) and constitutes our Group ModernSlavery Act Statement for the financial year2021/22.It outlines the key activities we have undertaken during the year and aims to provide information to understand our commitment as a responsible business to reduce the risks of modern slavery. We take seriously any allegation of human rights abuse in all its forms in any part of our organisation or our supply chain. It has been another year of significant disruption for global supply chains.  Ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, armed conflict, climate change pressures, inflationary pressures and labour shortages all contribute to a climate of heightened modern slavery risks. It has never been more important for brands to work in partnership with their suppliers and in collaboration with industry to manage these risks together.  We have made progress in some key areas this year including better use of data and analytics, developing our Responsible Sourcing Handbook and exploring high risk areas of our operations and our supply chainWe continue to assess ourselves against the IASC Modern Slavery Maturity Frameworkand have progressed in the category ‘Evolving Good Practice’ with future activity planned in ‘Leading on HumanRights Innovation’.

We continue to develop these policies and supporting implementation guidance to ensure we are recognising best practice and driving continuous improvement in our operations, in oursupplieroperations and in our shared supply chain. Human Rights Policy OurHuman Rights Policy confirms our commitment to respect internationally recognised human rights in line with the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organisation Conventions, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and HumanRights and the Children’s Rights and Business Principles.Supplier Code of ConductThis year we have updated ourSupplier Code of Conductto ensure that it continues to provide clear and comprehensive supplier expectations in relation to human rights, environmental, ethical and legal standards. We have added additional elements relating to supply chain transparency, business ethics, environmental compliance and animal welfare. Responsible Sourcing HandbookOur updatedResponsible Sourcing Handbookbrings our Supplier Code of Conduct to life with detailed implementation requirements, guidance and signposting to additional resources. We provide insight into how we embed these principles into our own operations and make commitments to our suppliers on how we conduct business; inviting them to tell us (confidentially if preferred) if we ever don’t meet these commitments.Whistleblowing mechanismIn 2022 we launched a new dedicated reporting mechanism for workers within our supply chain. We now require all Pets at Homeown labelproduct manufacturers to prominently display ourwhistleblowing poster containing ourcontact information so this is accessible to their workforce. A documented whistleblowing procedure on how to respond to any reports (including specific actions for safeguarding vulnerable persons) has been developed to support the investigation of any reports.We have not yet received any whistleblowing disclosures via this route but we’ve identified next steps to ensure that it is effective. This includes: developing further translations of the whistleblowing poster so that we cover key supply chain languages, continuing to ensure that the poster is displayed during all supplier visits and checking colleague awareness during ourResponsibleSourcingAudits.Acting responsibly and sustainably is at the heartof our business and last year we formally launched our social value strategy,Our Better World Pledge. This pledge ensures we operate our business sustainably and ethically whilst also applying high standards of governance.The Board, led by the Chair, Ian Burke, has ultimate responsibility for our social value strategy including our approach to uphold human rights and prevent modern slavery.  Our ESG Committee meets at least three times a year to approve and review the implementation of Our Better World Pledge. The Group Executive management team is supported by anumber of management committeesthatoverseedifferent areas of the agenda. The Product and Supply Chain Committee, which meets every six weeks, is responsible for developing the strategy for managing the environmental and ethical impacts of our products on our value chain. Our ESG Committee, Group Executive, Retailand Vet Executive receive an annual briefing on our modern slavery risks and our strategy. 5HumanRightsandModernSlaveryStatement2022GovernanceThis year the Product and Supply Chain Committeehave developeda product sustainability framework to support the implementationof our environmental and social requirementsacross our teams and with our suppliers.

Production capacity for some of our suppliers has been impacted by closures or disrupted raw material supply chains, which means there may be more indirect pressure to outsource production (or a part of production) in order to meet customer demand.Furthermore, our ability to identify unauthorisedsubcontractingis hampered by these restrictions which are preventing our site visits where we would ordinarily have assessed production capability and capacity. We recognise that 3rd partyethicalaudits in isolation are not always effective at identifying unauthorisedsubcontractingand given the heightened exposure and potential for poor labour standards and exploitation to occur, we are taking the following steps: 1.Updating our Supplier Code of Conduct to provide clear expectations regarding transparency and approval of all manufacturing and keysubcontractors2.Engagingdirectly with suppliers who we know are most likely to be impacted by operational and supply chain disruptions and focussing our due diligence activity accordingly. 3.Using quality and product due diligence to support identification ofsubcontracting. This includes reviewing the outputs of routine quality management system audits and product inspections. Child labourThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the root causes of child labour including poverty, limited access to quality education and a lack of decent employment opportunities for working adults. Furthermore, displacement caused by armed conflict, climate change and environmental disasters is predicted to fuel an increase in migration, which we know will put even more children at risk of exploitation. Whilst we have not identified any examples of child labour in our supply chain, we have completed a review of the processes and procedures we have in place for preventing, improving detention of and responding to child labour. This includes the introduction of aChildProtectionProcedure which provides clear guidance and actions to be taken in the event of identifying or suspecting child labour and we have developed detailed supplier guidance within ourResponsibleSourcingHandbook to support our suppliers in assessing child labour risk in their own operations and lower tiers of our shared supply chain. To ensure we keep up to date with the latest information and insights relating to child rights, we are in the process of joiningThe Centre for Child Rights in Business (CRIB) working group. The working group brings together brands to collaborate and share best practice and also enables us to access The Centre’s rapid response service if we were to identify underage labour. XinjiangThere are ongoing concerns of human rights violations andforced labour of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minoritiesin both Xinjiang, and throughout China through exploitativelabour transfer schemes. Whilst we are not sourcing any products directly from Xinjiang,we have identified the risk that a small number of food and fibre raw materials could originate from the region.We are working with our suppliers to achieve full traceability for high risk raw materials and we are committed to resourcing if we identify any commodities originating from Xinjiang. Where we are not able to obtain credible supply chain transparency back to raw materials, we are committed to reducing risks by resourcing or the use of material certification schemes. We have not identified any suppliers who are using Xinjiang labour transfer schemes but we recognise the limitations of traditional3rdparty ethical audits in identifying this issue. We are focussed on improving our due diligence to identify and protect all vulnerable worker groups in our supply chain.Migrant LabourThis year we completed a mapping exercise to understand where cross-border migrant labour is used across our supply chain.We are now working with relevant suppliers to conduct a deep dive into their recruitment practices to ensure we and they understand risks and to ensure there is adequate oversight of recruitment agents.  If any concerns are identified, we’ll work with suppliers on appropriate corrective and preventative actions.Procurement supply chainIn order to support effective prioritisation of our activity in procurement supply chains,in the coming year, we’ll be issuing a sustainability survey to all suppliers asking them to outline their governance and due diligence for managing social and environmental risks in their ownoperations and their supply chain. We’ll use the outputs to develop a risk based strategy and programme for our procurement operations. Case Study –UK Warehousing & LogisticsOur distribution centres are operated directly by Pets at Homeand our permanent distribution centre colleagues are supported during busy periods by temporary agency workers. We previously identified UK temporary labour as high risk for modern slavery, so in 2022 we conducted a comprehensive Responsible Recruitment Audit of all the active temporary labour agencies engaged across our 3 warehouse operations. The audit was led by an independent labour provider specialist. The audit process has been invaluable in deepening our understanding of current risks and challenges associated withthe recruitment of temporary labour and has identified a number of opportunities for both our operational teams and the agencies to improve and implement best practice. This includes an opportunity to develop and deliver bespoke modern slavery awareness training targeted at our distribution colleagues, so this forms a key action for the coming year.  We were really pleased to hear from our temporary colleagues about the success of our buddy system which supports the onboarding and integration of all new team members so we have great foundations to build upon.Case Study –Uniform tenderIn 2022 we conducted a tender for supplying our colleague uniform using a new assessment template.  Suppliers were asked to provide detailed information to enable us to assess the maturity of their systems for managing human rights risks, environmental risks, quality, service, sustainable material sourcing and sustainable manufacturing practices.  The results were scored to allow us to compare suppliers against each of these different elements. It enabled us not only select the strongest supplier overall but also helped to highlight areas for improvement which we are now supporting our supplier with.DataIn 2021 we joined Sedexas a retailer member. Sedexenables us to manage our audit data and corrective action plan close out more efficiently.  We are in process of onboarding our suppliers and beginning to use the risk tool and forced labour reports to support our prioritisation of supplier visits and provide insights to our suppliers on key sourcing risks. We have also developed and begun to roll out our new collaborative supply chain platform CBX which enables us to manage the end-to-end product and supplier compliance process more efficiently and control data much more effectively. Both these new tools enable us to record more information about our suppliers and the makeup of their workforce. This insight enables us to understand more about the people in our supply chain so we can focus support and compliance activity on those that are most vulnerable.Audit programme and key performance indictorsWe require new andhigh risksuppliers to undergo 3rd party ethical audits which assess labour standards, health & safety and environmental compliance. We work closely with our suppliers to close out areas ofnon-compliance. However, we recognise that these audits are not always the most effective tool in identifying the most egregious human rights violations and so we have launched a programme ofResponsibleSourcingAudits conducted by our in-house Responsible Sourcing Specialist. These audits may be completed instead of, or in addition to a 3rd party ethical audit. The aim of these Responsible SourcingAudits is to not only assess and improve labour conditions in our suppliers’ direct operations but to support capacity building for identifying and mitigating human rights and environmental risks downstream inour supply chain. Our Responsible Sourcing Specialist joined Pets at Homein July 2021and is embedded operationally within ourTechnical andProductDevelopmentTeam while also working closely with the Group Head of Social Value and the Company Secretary on our Group wide human rights strategy and approach. During the year1203rd party ethical audits from111manufacturing sites were completed and reviewed. We completed9ResponsibleSourcingAudits.4issues were raised against the employment is freely chosen category and these related to a lack ofan up to date modernslavery statement, lack of a forced labour policyand opportunities to improve training and awareness of modern slavery risks. All issues are followed up with suppliers to ensure they areremediated.7HumanRightsandModernSlaveryStatement2022What’snext?WeareworkingwithElevatetocompleteapilotprogrammeofinitially5‘deepdive’ethicalauditssupportedbyaworkervoicesurvey.Wewanttounderstandifthisimprovesthedetectionofissueswhichmayotherwisegounreportedonmoretraditionalsocialaudits.WehaveprioritisedtheseauditsinChina,asCOVID-19restrictionsarestillpreventingourowncolleaguesuppliervisits.All colleagues are required to complete our bespoke online training course on modern slavery and from April 2020, completion of mandatory training, which includes this module, forms part of all colleagues’ personal objectives.  We continue to use our annual supplier conference to raise awareness of modern slavery and this provides a forum where suppliers can ask questions and raise any concerns.  Our updated Responsible Sourcing Handbook provides best practice guidance to suppliers and also signposts to training resources. As we conduct our own Responsible Sourcing Audits, we set specific action plans where training needs are highlighted.We recognise the importance of collaboration and partnerships for sharing and developing industry best practice.TrainingPartnerships &CollaborationWhat’snext?Forour colleaguesWe are developing bespoke modern slavery awareness training targeted at our distribution colleagues so they understand how to spot the signs of modern slavery and how to report any concerns they may have.ForoursuppliersWe are developing a supplier portal which will include information and resources to support suppliers’ continuous improvement in human rights and other responsible sourcing areas including sustainability.What’snext?8HumanRightsandModernSlaveryStatement2022We are an active member ofBRC’s CSR Communityand will continue to collaborate in working groups which support the development of best practice in human rights due diligence. We have joined Sedexto help us manage our supply chain information but Sedexalso provides a community for collaboration and the development of guidance, tools and industry standards. Our Responsible Sourcing Specialist has joined for the Technical Advisory Group to support the development of the next iteration of SMETA, SMETA X.To ensure we keep up to date with the latest information and insights relating to child rights, we are in the process of joiningThe Centre for Child Rights in Business (CRIB) working group. The working group brings together brands to collaborate and share best practice. We are committed to identifying and addressing modern slavery and human rights risk in our business and throughout our supply chain. Within this statement we have highlighted the key opportunities for the financial year ahead which includes: publishing our tier 1 Pets at Homeown label supply chain, developing bespoke modern slavery training for our distribution centre colleagues and trialling worker voice surveys in our China supply base. We are committed to continuous improvement which supports our vision to be the best pet care business in the world.ThePetsatHomeGroupPlcboardofdirectorsapprovedthisstatementata meetingoftheBoardon14thSeptember2022.LookingAhead9HumanRightsandModernSlaveryStatement2022Footnote:Thisstatementapplies to PetsatHomeLimited and Companion Care (Services) Limited, which fall within the scope of section54(2) of theModernSlaveryAct2015.
