The period of reporting for this Statement is for the year ended 31 December 2021. This Statement serves as a progress report following key actions taken subsequent to the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2020.OUR ORGANISATION, STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN A. About Sime Darby Plantation Sime Darby Plantation (SDP) is the world’s largest oil palm plantation company by planted area, producing approximately 2.373 million tonnes or 3.3% of global Crude Palm Oil. We are also the world’s largest producer of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO), accounting for around 14.7% of market share of world production by volume. As a globally integrated plantation company, SDP is involved in the full spectrum of the palm oil value chain, from upstream to downstream activities, Research and Development (R&D), renewables and agribusiness.  Our Upstream operations, consisting predominantly of oil palm cultivation, harvesting and milling, are located across Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. We operate and manage 240 plantation estates and 69 palm oil mills in those countries.  Our Downstream business, Sime Darby Oils (SDO), spans 12 countries. This includes the United Kingdom as well as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, China, Germany, South Africa, the Netherlands, Philippines, USA and Papua New Guinea. Our downstream business involves the manufacturing as well as the sales and marketing of oils and fats products, oleo-chemicals, palm oil-based biodiesel, nutraceuticals and other derivatives.  On a far smaller scale, SDP is also involved in rubber and sugarcane plantations, coconut crushing as well as cattle rearing. Further details of the Company can be found on our website.                                                                                                                www.simedarbyplantation.com  SDP is committed to operational excellence, innovation and sustainability. SDP has R&D centres in Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and Innovation Centres located in Malaysia, the Netherlands and South Africa, with technologists and scientists assisting to improve every aspect of our value chain; from developing quality planting materials and environmental-friendly fertilisers to enhancing the systems and processes in cultivating, harvesting and milling, to producing both high quality and traceable refined palm oil and palm kernel products.B. Our Supply Chain SDP believes in transparency and traceability. With the growing demand for palm oil, traceability is crucial to help producers understand supply chains, improve reporting and implement effective action plans to halt deforestation and mitigate negative environmental impacts. As part of our due diligence approach, we monitor the traceability and No Deforestation, Peat and Exploitation (NDPE) compliance of our entire supply chain. Suppliers who are not in compliance with the Company’s policies are engaged for remedial action. Details in relation to our commitments to supply chain sustainability can be found in our Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2021.SIME DARBY PLANTATION4Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021RESPONDING TO THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (USCBP)   Sime Darby Plantation Berhad (SDP) shares the universal condemnation of forced labour and is determined to be part of the solution when it comes to eliminating forced labour in all its forms. After the issuance of the Withhold Release Order (WRO) by the United States Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), we engaged an ethical trade consultancy to undertake a full-scale, independent assessment spanning our Malaysian operations. ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE USCBPOn 6 July 2020 SDP was made aware of a petition that was submitted by Liberty Shared, a Hong Kong based non-governmental organisation, to the USCBP on 20 April 2020. There were allegations of forced labour and child labour on SDP’s estates, in the petition. On 30 December 2020, the USCBP issued a WRO against SDP based on information it said, “reasonably indicates the presence of all 11 of the International Labour Organisation’s forced labor indicators in SDP’s production process”. This was converted to a Notice of Finding which took effect on 28 January 2022. Following the filing of the initial complaint, SDP undertook an extensive internal audit of our Malaysian operations. We also appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Singapore to engage with Liberty Shared to better understand the issues at hand. Subsequently, after the imposition of the WRO, we appointed independent experts to assess our operations against the 11 International Labour Organisation (ILO) Forced Labour Indicators (FLIs). Simultaneously, SDP committed to a comprehensive internal exercise to address any and all issues on the ground as part of a continuous improvement plan.

We have reinforced the respect for human rights in our culture, to foster and support appropriate behaviours, beliefs and values. SDP’s governance structure was established prior to our listing in November 2017, reflecting our position as a fully integrated plantation company committed to sustainable development. The SDP Main Board’s strategic intent, roles and powers, including those which it delegates to Management, are outlined in the Board Charter. The Charter also sets the terms of reference of the five Board Committees. The Board Committees assist the Main Board in the discharge of statutory and fiduciary responsibilities. The five Board Committees are, Governance & Audit Committee, Nomination & Remuneration Committee, Risk Management Committee, Sustainability Committee and Tender Committee (refer to chart below).SIME DARBY PLANTATION6Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021Enhanced Governance StructureResponding to the concerns raised by the USCBP, we evaluated our governance structure and management systems. Following this, a Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP) directly focused on the ILO’s FLIs was developed with the purpose of embracing new norms, acquiring knowledge and effecting culture change.  To monitor the ongoing assessment and the implementation of the CIP, from July 2021, the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) met fortnightly. Reporting to the BSC was a Steering Committee (SC) chaired by the Group Managing Director (GMD), which met weekly. The SC was supported by a taskforce and working group chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), which met at least twice a week and comprised seven separate workstreams led by members of the Plantation Leadership Committee (PLC) or functional heads. By demonstrating the commitment of SDP’s senior management and their direct involvement in the initiatives being deployed, we placed heavier emphasis on sustainability within formal performance management targets and thus are effecting transformative behavioural change.The taskforce established seven workstreams to address specific FLIs, with specific outcomes. Over 500,000 work hours involving over 1,200 individuals and 10,000 meetings have been invested in the CIP over the course of 12 months to enhance SDP’s human rights practices. Policies and ProceduresSDP has several policies and procedures in place underlining our commitment to respecting human rights, which clearly set out how we identify and address human rights issues within our business and our supply chains. These policies and procedures have evolved over time but were re-evaluated in 2021 to assess their effectiveness. Where necessary, they have been strengthened or updated to adapt to our dynamic environment. 1. Human Rights Charter (HRC)  As a responsible global corporate citizen, we believe that businesses must respect, support and uphold fundamental human rights. SDP’s commitment is reflected in our HRC, which is part of our core values and governed by the Code of Business Conduct and Group Policies & Authorities.

Our commitments include: • Engaging with and Empowering Communities for Inclusive Development • Respecting and Upholding Labour Rights • Respecting and Upholding Children’s Rights • Protection of Human Rights Defenders, Whistle blowers, Complainants and Community Spokespersons When faced with conflicts between local and international norms and/or standards, SDP will uphold the higher standard, to the extent possible. The HRC was developed in 2017 and was reviewed in 2020 to strengthen our commitment and alignment to international standards and practices. 2. Protection of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) Policy                               This policy is SDP’s approach in affording protection to Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) by ensuring internal mechanisms prevent harm and protect them, and that we respond to complaints that are raised. As the Group respects and safeguards human rights, we recognise HRDs have the role and responsibility of upholding human rights. We also recognise the need for them to be able to lodge complaints that may arise from their business activities and relationships with SDP in confidence. It is also acknowledged that a HRD’s decision to lodge a complaint may in some instances result in risks to their safety and/or security. This policy, developed in 2020, serves as an operational guidance on commitments in the HRC, and goes by the general principles of: • Confidentiality and Anonymity • Equality and Non-Discrimination • Protection Against Threats and Retaliation • Mechanism – Whistleblowing (WB) Channels • Training • Remedies3. Migrant Worker Responsible Recruitment Procedure (RRP) SDP does not tolerate any and all forms of forced or bonded labour, slavery, human trafficking, and/or sexual exploitation. SDP ensures that our workforce is hired ethically and responsibly according to commitments outlined in the HRC. As we hire a large workforce of foreign workers in our Malaysian operations, SDP believes that responsible recruitment is a key enabler in adopting labour practices that respect workers’ rights. This approach respects workers’ rights by providing fair and favourable recruitment and working conditions. SDP focuses on the following main aspects of Responsible Recruitment: • No charging of recruitment fees and related costs • Clear and transparent terms and conditions of employment • No withholding of passports or personal documents, other than what is necessary for government processing of visas, etc. • Non-discriminationSIME DARBY PLANTATION8Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021 The procedure document outlines the general principles of the ethical recruitment process and details all the official costs borne by the Company related to the recruitment of workers. SDP’s approach includes conducting on-going due diligence to identify salient issues that have potential impact on foreign workers’ rights. To support this, grievance processes are also in place and monitored to provide workers with access to remedy and to voice concerns. This procedure serves as operational guidance on SDP’s commitments in the HRC and Responsible Agriculture Charter. 4. Responsible Agriculture Charter (RAC)  The RAC outlines SDP’s commitments to no deforestation, no new development on peat, and no exploitation of the rights of indigenous peoples, workers and local communities (NDPE). Launched in September 2016, this Charter defines our commitment to achieving excellence across our business engagements without compromising the responsibility to protect and improve the interdependent and mutually supportive foundations of sustainability which are people, planet and prosperity. These commitments are: • Protect and conserve biodiversity and ecosystems • Commitment towards no deforestation and no new development on peat • Reduce climate change impacts and enhance resilience • Promote responsible consumption and production • Enhance supply chain traceability These commitments are also extended to include stakeholders within the supply chain and communities surrounding and affected by our operations. SDP believes that traceability of our global supply chain and responsible sourcing are key drivers to support the industry to increase sustainable palm oil production. Acknowledging the challenges, SDP strives to jointly seek innovative solutions to ensure a balanced outcome, and to avoid exclusion. SDP is guided by leading sustainability certification schemes as the baseline for determining compliance to our commitments and we continuously seek holistic and practical systems to better protect people and the environment. The implementation of these commitments is guided by policies and guidelines designed to ensure consistency and standardisation across SDP’s operations and businesses.5. Group Sustainability & Quality Policy Statement This policy outlines our sustainability goals as we aim to be the leading integrated producer and supplier of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO).  In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) this policy covers commitments on: • Promoting Good Governance and Transparency • Contributing to a better society • Minimising environmental harm • Delivering sustainable qualitySIME DARBY PLANTATION9Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021KEY INITIATIVES IN 2021 In the year under review, the initiatives below were undertaken in line with our commitments and aspirations for continuous improvements. The scope of work in the year 2021 has been focussed largely on our operations in Malaysia.The events that unfolded in 2020 and 2021 have reinforced our belief that people are the backbone of our Company. Unprecedented crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating floods in Malaysia have tested our measures in protecting employees and surrounding communities. SDP has also been subject to an extra layer of scrutiny due to concerns about forced labour at our Malaysian upstream operations. Faced with these challenging circumstances, we realise that while we have committed to stringent standards in principle, we must improve their implementation on the ground. In the face of these challenges, we are committed to going above and beyond minimum requirements, setting an example for the industry.Giving our Workers a VoiceGrievance Channels – Enhanced Availability and AwarenessSeveral grievance channels have been in place for many years. In 2019, SDP collaborated with Nestle and ELEVATE to launch the “Suara Kami” (“Our Voice”) Helpline, to provide independent third-party help for our workers in Malaysia. (ELEVATE is a leading business risk and sustainability solutions provider.) The “Suara Kami” Helpline provides an avenue for workers to report on working conditions, recruitment, safety and other issues. In line with our HRC, SDP also works with our partners to empower unions to better disseminate information, improve awareness of workers’ rights and represent the welfare and wellbeing of workers. However, on re-evaluating how these work in practice, SDP identified some gaps, particularly in the way that grievances were being monitored and escalated. This was evidenced by the fact that too few workers were using the channels available to air their grievances.To remedy this, SDP carried out extensive work to identify the limitations of existing grievance mechanisms, then agreed on a workstream outcome and rolled out refreshed grievance mechanisms. With the aim of reinforcing trust, key areas of focus were to: (i) increase awareness of the grievance channels;(ii) improve oversight of grievances and accountability for grievance handling;(iii) ensure safeguarding of workers is guaranteed (no retaliation); and (iv) improve management capability to investigate and resolve grievances effectivelyAt the end of August 2021, SDP introduced the Workers’ Helpline, an independent third-party worker grievance channel with multiple languages and multi-interface, supported by the Ulula Case Management system, a platform that collects grievances and allows workers to anonymously raise concerns safely and securely at any time and to digitally connect with support for real-time case management. SDP created WhatsApp videos in relevant languages to describe how workers can raise concerns. Reminders about these channels are also delivered at morning muster briefings, awareness sessions, and through posters and printed flyers that are distributed with payslips and displayed at prominent locations and common areas such as sports clubs and halls.SIME DARBY PLANTATION10Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021We also strengthened our support system for handling grievances and complaints of wrongdoing, clearly defining roles and responsibilities for case management, investigation and reporting. All grievances received are channelled to the newly established Grievance Unit, which is a centralised unit at Headquarters (HQ), to capture informal and formal complaints and concerns systematically. This allows SDP to address issues that can be readily resolved or refer issues to the investigating team when substantive expertise is necessary. We then follow up with the complainant via the call handler to ensure that the issue is resolved in a fair and timely manner. On a weekly basis, the Grievance Committee (GC) which has been set up, and Steering Committee monitor the status of new complaints and on-going complaints, to ensure that all are appropriately addressed up to the point of resolution within established timelines. Cases are handled based on the nature of the investigation required, severity of event (as it relates to an ILO indicator) and potential threat to workers, and thereafter reported and deliberated on by the BSC at their meetings.  Any cases of wrongdoing are additionally tracked and monitored by the WB Unit, WB Committee and the Board Governance and Audit Committee, to ensure that appropriate consequence management actions are taken when wrongdoing has been found. This enhanced system of central grievance monitoring ensures that SDP’s standard operating procedures, terms of reference and group policies can be updated and developed to reflect issues identified in the field. The system has also helped to improve independence over grievance monitoring and established clarity in the reporting lines. Social Dialogues – Improving Engagement with WorkersIn October 2021, SDP launched the Social Dialogue initiative that allows workers to elect employee representatives for each nationality at our estates and mills. Social Dialogue is a structured approach that SDP has adopted to create a formal two-way communication platform at the Operating Unit (OU) level. Elected worker representatives (WRs) from all nationalities and OU management can discuss issues related to worker welfare and concerns. WRs are not only appointed through nominations by the workers themselves but are also empowered to suggest improvements. SDP believes this is the first programme of its kind among palm oil plantation companies in Malaysia, and we hope it will become a key platform to discuss many other initiatives. Other Key Enhancements to a Worker’s ExperienceEnhancements in Ethical Recruitment and Management of Foreign WorkersSDP recruits workers ethically, treats them fairly and with respect, and provides decent working and living conditions. SDP’s recruitment process is fair and transparent, and workers agree to work with SDP freely and with their informed consent. All wages and benefits, including housing and other amenities, are accurately and honestly described to ensure consent is informed. (i) The RRP was updated in August 2021. This included undertaking a new tender for recruitment agents in line with this updated recruitment procedure. These updates and rollout of the tender have been done in collaboration with a workers recruitment specialist.                         (ii) All recruits are given an offer letter in their own language to ensure individuals are informed, and have consented to undertake the employment. (iii) Workers are briefed at the point of recruitment on salient matters. This is to ensure workers understand the terms of their offer and contract. Workers sign their contracts on their own free will without any coercion or intimidation.(iv) Workers’ employment contracts have the same terms as the letter of offer given to them in their countries of origin, in their own language.SIME DARBY PLANTATION11Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021Workers’ identification and other personal documents are their own and will not be retained by SDP other than for legal and/or administrative requirements such as the renewal of work visas. All SDP workers are provided with personal lockers to keep important personal items in a safe place. Some of the measures in place in SDP Upstream Malaysia operations are:(i) Each worker is provided with a secure locker in his or her home for the safekeeping of personal documents. Workers are also briefed on the purpose of the lockers and their rights to retention of their own documents.(ii) To ensure consistency of implementation of all policies, SDP implemented a Foreign Worker Management System (FWMS) as the sole database for input, update, tracking and monitoring of passports and work permits by the Workforce Management Unit (WMU). (iii) A centralised system was implemented to initiate, execute and monitor passport renewals at HQ level under the WMU. Remediation of Recruitment FeesIn February 2022, we announced our plan to reimburse more than 34,000 current and former workers who were employed on or after 1 November 2018, an aggregate one-off sum of over RM82 million.  This is to remediate recruitment fees that may have been incurred (unreported payments charged by agents, sub-agents or other third parties in countries of origin, in contravention of SDP’s zero recruitment fee policy). Individual reimbursements were calculated, by an independent 3rd party, as a sum of the average worker-reported recruitment fees and related costs, by nationality. Exchange rates, inflation since the date of payment and interest (at 2%) was applied to represent at least part of the lost economic opportunity cost. All reimbursements are being paid as a single lump-sum payment to foreign workers. We have also established a Sinking Fund Governance Committee comprising 2 independent directors, 2 members of senior management and 1 external legal counsel. This committee oversees the disbursement of sums to former foreign workers who were working for SDP on or after 1 November 2018.As at 8 June 2022, 14,514 active workers have been reimbursed with the remainder actively nominating next of kin for payment or opening their own bank accounts to receive payment. Legal counsel have been appointed in various jurisdictions to administer the claims process for inactive or former workers. Their role includes advertising in local media, establishing dedicated hotlines and receiving & validating claims. 100% of all payments to active and inactive workers are verified by PwC.Improving Freedom of Movement and Access to AmenitiesAll workers are free to move within and beyond OUs. They are only required to inform a superior or security personnel of their intentions to leave an OU during work hours or for their own wellbeing/safety (for example, during Government imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid 19). Access to urban centres is provided regularly and/or, as and when the need arises. Workers have their own communications devices and are able to contact their families or friends. SIME DARBY PLANTATION12Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021Ensuring Decent Wages and Working Hours SDP provides decent and fair wages, reasonable working hours with adequate rest, achievable productivity targets and voluntary overtime. This includes limiting overtime to a maximum of 4 hours a day and ensuring that workers do not work more than 13 consecutive days without rest. SDP does not withhold wages. Significant effort has been put in place to help workers understand how much they are paid and how the incentive programmes work. Workers are paid twice a month, have access to their own bank accounts and are able to access their funds. Enhancements include the provision of payslips and wage code glossaries in native languages as well as briefing sessions for workers in assisting them to understand their wages. Improving Working and Living ConditionsAll workers are entitled to free and fair employment, and decent living and working conditions which are safe and healthy. Workers are entitled to and receive adequate training and are provided with necessary protective equipment. We support the wellbeing of our workers, employees, and communities. Revised management systems have been implemented and are being monitored and reviewed. This includes input from workers to develop a worker-centric Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) system. In particular, input from workers is sought in relation to hazard identification and mitigation as well as in testing suitability of personal protective equipment, prior to adoption and roll-out.  Provision and access to medical facilities have also been enhanced with governance over medical practices being undertaken via a newly appointed Chief Medical Officer, who is overseen by the Medical Advisory Council. Workers and their immediate families are entitled to adequate housing with ready access to all their basic needs, which includes potable water, electricity, healthcare, access to urban centres, places of worship and educational facilities for their children. Recreational areas and allotments are provided for their use. Policies have been enhanced to ensure timely resolution of repairs and other maintenance issues. In addition, a dedicated budget of RM700 per house per annum has been established and must be utilised by site management. This is done with the assistance of over 200 handymen, carpenters and electricians who are onsite to ensure speedy resolution of repairs & maintenance. Improving Worker Dynamics Around Acceptable Behaviours SDP strictly forbids any and all forms of physical and/or sexual violence, and intimidation. Workers have the right to raise any complaints or concerns and are regularly informed of available channels of communication, their right to a safe work environment and protection. Toolbox exercises between workers and site management were undertaken at every operating site to discuss and agree on acceptable and non-acceptable behaviours. Workers were also reminded about the various channels they have at their disposal, namely the grievance hotlines and social dialogues to raise concerns over unacceptable behaviours at these sessions.  Since 2010, SDP has had a Gender Policy to protect the rights of women in a male dominated environment. The commitment is now embedded in the HRC. Gender committees were established at all estates and mills to advance workplace discussions affecting women such as, violence and sexual harassment, women’s health and, financial and retirement planning.  Using the RSPO Gender Guidance as well as SDP’s commitment in the HRC, the Gender Representatives main activities have been to promote a safe environment for women workers to raise concerns as well as create awareness about gender-based violence and harassment throughout the entire workplace.SIME DARBY PLANTATION13Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement FY2021Upholding children’s rightsSDP does not employ anyone under 18 for any work. The importance of keeping children away from all places and areas of work is emphasised and communicated to everyone in our supply chain, including smallholders and contractors. SDP instituted a zero-tolerance policy towards child labour in 2010 with severe consequence management (including termination) for any non-compliance with this policy. SDP understands that children may assist their families on farms often due to socioeconomic factors, such as low household income and the lack of educational opportunities. SDP has collaborated with local consulates and NGOs to facilitate the provision of schooling for all children living on our operating sites. Free childcare is also provided at all our operating sites. Ensuring Sustainability via Structural Changes in MalaysiaKey structural changes have been instituted in Upstream Malaysia to ensure dedicated focus on worker welfare as well as to ensure continued compliance with ILO and sustainability standards. To this end, a new Social Welfare & Services (SWS) department has been established.This dedicated team is responsible for overseeing the implementation of policies and procedures related to the well-being and safety of workers, ensuring that day-to-day Upstream Operations comply with internationally recognised best practices around human rights and worker welfare. As of January 2022, SDP has appointed 40 fulltime dedicated Site Safety and Sustainability Officers (SSSO) to assist and support our strategic OUs (SOUs) with managing safety and sustainability initiatives on the ground, with a particular focus on human rights matters. The new officers are tasked with managing overall documentation, providing on-site support for operations compliance monitoring, and setting out actionable immediate next steps in managing any safety and sustainability concern or issue, should they arise.ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY  OF THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE MOVING FORWARDSDP’s CIP examined the additional resources needed to strengthen overall governance mechanisms for labour practices and also to ensure that changes implemented are sustainable. This was central to the enhancement programme, given the breadth and span of the  Group’s operations. Thus, three of seven workstreams were dedicated to enhancing these governance mechanisms.and safety of workers, ensuring that day-to-day Upstream Operations comply with internationally  As of January 2022, 40 fulltime dedicated Site Safety and Sustainability Officers (SSSO) have been appointed to assist and support the strategic OUs (SOUs) with managing safety and, sustainability initiatives on the ground, with a particular focus on human rights.

This is particularly important as consequence management and accountability will ensure a shift in culture and to clearly establish the tone from the top. Regular audits and engagement exercises have been undertaken awareness of all SDP’s new policies, guidelines, processes and systems 2. Grievance Channels The key objective was to win trust  and enable the workforce to raise issues without fear of retaliation. Having reviewed its grievance channels and how these work in practice, SDP identified some gaps, particular in the way that grievances were being monitored and escalated. This was evidenced by the fact that too few workers were using the channels available to air their grievances. To remedy this, SDP carried out extensive work to identify the limitations of its grievance 1.

A Chief Medical Officer who is overseen by a Medical Advisory Council has also been appointed to enhance governance over medical practices.To emphasise a zero-tolerance approach, SDP has taken stern and swift action against those who have not adhered to the Company’s policies. This is particularly important as consequence management and accountability will ensure a shift in culture and to clearly establish the tone from the top.Regular audits and engagement exercises have been undertaken with estate management to ensure awareness of all SDP’s new policies, guidelines, processes, and systems to ensure both understanding and compliance. Driving & Sustaining Behavioural Change – Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ScorecardSDP has developed an ESG Scorecard for Upstream Malaysia outlining Key Performance Indicators that reflect the initiatives we have undertaken to meet the requirements of the ILO and to fully address the FLIs. Communicated to all estates and mills in January 2022, this scorecard supplements the Main Financial & Operational Scorecard (Main Scorecard) and supersedes a previous system which incorporated a Sustainability Health Index (SHI). This standalone ESG scorecard came into effect in the 2022 Financial Year and progress will be measured on a quarterly basis.Human Rights TrainingAt SDP, we continuously invest in capacity building and education of all our employees. During the year under review, despite challenges in conducting face to face trainings in view of social distancing requirements and movement restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, SDP continued to conduct virtual training to all key functions in Upstream Malaysia. Trainings were conducted for all estate and mill Managers, Assistant Managers, Regional Human Resources, Regional Sustainability teams as well as WRs. Head office functions such as the WMU were also trained on topics relevant to their work functions. We will continue our training efforts to all other operating units in our global operations through physical as well as virtual platforms.
