Policies and processes reflect our commitment to mitigating human rights risks and remediation of any adverse impacts that our business has caused or contributed to. We conduct our business in an ethical manner that focuses on human rights related to the provision of labour and working conditions throughout our supply chain, ensuring that people are treated fairly and that their human rights are protected and respected. This includes rights to fair pay, safe working conditions and protection from modern slavery. We seek to develop long term relationships with those businesses that share our ethical standards and are dedicated to working within the remit of this policy.  Due Diligence  We require all our fruit growers, and encourage our other suppliers, to be members of SEDEX, (the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), maintain their SAQ, (Self-Assessment Questionnaire), and to undertake an ethical audit based on risk, ideally a SMETA audit within an agreed timeframe by an approved third-party auditor.   Incorporated into our initiatives to identify and address risks of modern slavery are systems that:  • Develop, implement and train out relevant policies and procedures • Improve recruitment and onboarding processes within our own business to reduce the risk of third parties engaged in exploitation infiltrating our business • Improve awareness and understanding of modern slavery to enable identification of any modern slavery cases • Embed worker voice channels • Enable an effective response to any suspected cases to protect victims • Improve auditing, identification, and mitigation of risk amongst our labour providers, including agency worker interviews • Regular review of our human rights’ due diligence risk assessment to better identify and manage risks of modern slavery in our supply chain • Identify and assess Base Code non-conformances through audit of labour providers and interviewing workers in our supply chain, including incorporating the Anonymous & Wilder direct reporting tool amongst our own workforce and that of our suppliers • Mitigate the risk of slavery, human trafficking, and other Base Code non-conformances by working with suppliers on CAPs, (Corrective Action Plans) • Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chain through dialogue with our suppliers to understand the root causes and agree a course of action to resolve them; development and accessibility to bespoke learning interventions, the use of CAPs and follow up visits • Protect whistleblowers                       Modern Slavery Statement  March 2023      Monitoring and Reporting Our strategic steering group is reviewed to ensure fitness for purpose in driving our progress against ethical trading KPIs and our ethical trade objectives. We are completing the Stronger Together direct reporting tool on an annual basis to also measure our progress against our ethical trading action plan, assess our human rights due diligence approach and benchmark ourselves against our peers.

We are proactive members of relevant forums such as and FNET, (Food Network for Ethical Trade) and continue to sponsor the Spanish Ethical Forum, in which our key Spanish suppliers participate.  Dedicated to building long term supplier relationships, we seek to influence commitment to ethical trading practices and increase transparency in our supply chain.  We also now monitor and report our progress against each of the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.
