  Modern Slavery Act Statement – January 2023   Our business  As a leading provider of agronomy services, technology and strategic advice, Agrii combines excellence and innovation with the latest research and development to ensure our customers can meet today’s farming challenges with the highest degree of knowledge and confidence. We supply seed, fertiliser, agri-chemical and a wide range of other products and services to our customers, as well as the provision of farming advice. Agrii is the trading name of Masstock Arable (UK) limited and United Agri Products limited.  Our ethical standards  Agrii is committed to conducting itself with the highest ethical and legal standards, ensuring that the operations within Agrii and its supply chain meet those standards at all times. Agrii is committed to ensure that it is compliant with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“MSA”) and will not accept non-compliance with the MSA within its own operations or those of partners or suppliers. We are aware that human traffickers and illegal/unlicensed gang-masters target a range of industries including those involved in the agricultural sector. It remains important that we maintain our vigilance and continually improve our controls and procedures.  Continuous Improvement  We recognise that risk assessment, management oversight and continuous improvement are important and we closely monitor UK government guidance, updates and requirements. Agrii continues to review and improve upon its actions and due diligence measures, including, but not limited to, the following:  - Operation of a MSA steering group comprised of senior HR, Operations, Procurement and Finance representatives to discuss, implement and develop MSA controls and procedures and review progress.  - Implementing a new ‘code of conduct for suppliers’ covering a number of areas consistent with the general context of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, but with specific focus on: people & labour; business ethics & compliance; and health, safety and environment.   - Updating our procurement policy in relation to good procurement practice and re-emphasising our commitments to identifying and taking action against any modern slavery taking place in our supply chain.   - Introducing a ‘code of conduct for employees’ which reiterates our stance on modern slavery, in addition to setting out various other commitments to our own people, the communities in which we work and to the environment.   - Continuing our engagement with our supplier base to ensure awareness of our stance on modern slavery. In the last year alone we have seen in excess of 260 additional suppliers sign up to our core principles relating to the prevention of modern slavery. This follows the improvements made to our method of communicating with our suppliers in 2021. At the time of this statement, the majority of product we source is from suppliers who have already signed up to our principles on modern slavery.  - Requirement for new and existing employees to undertake our e-learning training on modern slavery to improve general awareness and understanding of the risks around it. To that end, the vast majority of our employees have already completed the training and with remaining employees, including new starters, being asked to complete their training in the near term.   - Updating and communicating to all employees our ‘employee guidance’ document, particularly designed for those working closely within UK agricultural networks to help support improved awareness of modern slavery risks and how to identify and report concerns.  - Updating of our internal modern slavery policy which sets out Agrii’s response to the MSA, including details of current procedures that we have put in place. Included within the policy, amongst other things, is an emphasis that each employee has a role and duty to report concerns.   Other existing procedures  As well as the above measures, we will also continue to take the following steps to ensure that we further combat slavery and human trafficking:  • Provide an opportunity for all employees to identify risks anonymously through a whistleblowing process which is detailed on the Company intranet and communicated in our modern slavery policy.  • Continue our internal ‘risk checks’ to ensure that any permanent or seasonal employment (within our 800-900 workforce, based at various sites within the UK including our production facilities) does not contravene our own ethical standards or any legislation or government guidance.  • Commit to promptly answering questions posed by our customers (predominantly farmers and growers) in respect of the MSA who wish to know more about our operations and / or our supply chain.  • Continue to monitor and review our MSA processes, ensuring that we are also keeping up to date with proposed government amendments to the legislation, including sourcing external legal advice where appropriate to do so.   Our supply chains  We are a distributor and our supply chain is global in its reach. We source from manufacturers directly or through intermediaries. Many of our suppliers are large in scale with deemed low-risk of non-compliance to the MSA. However we remain vigilant to all risks, particularly in small-scale suppliers such as farms and growers in whose sector there may sometimes be a higher risk of unlicensed, seasonal manual labour.  Agrii is committed to ensuring our supply chain is free from human rights abuses and modern slavery. We actively welcome comments and suggestions from anyone within our supply chain about how we can improve our operations or further reduce risks in our supply chain.

In the last year we have seen in excess of 350  new and existing suppliers sign up to our core principles  on modern slavery and we’ve recently made further improvements to  our method of communicating with our suppliers. At the time of this statement, the majority of product we source is from suppliers who have already signed up to our principles on modern slavery.  - Requirement for new and existing employees to undertake our e-learning training on modern slavery to improve general awareness and understanding of the risks around it. To that end, the vast majority  of our employees have already completed the training and we have set further targets  over the coming year. Additionally, we are currently designing more specific educational content for key roles who work closely within agricultural networks, to help support improved awareness of modern slavery risks and how to identify and report concerns.  - Updating of our internal modern slavery policy which sets out Agrii’s response to the MSA, including details of current procedures that we have put in place. Our recent enhancements to the policy, amongst other things, highlights the role and duty of each employee to report concerns.  - Ongoing monitoring of potential risks that might appear in our supply chain or with our partners or suppliers. We have made some amendments to the annual process by which we validate the source of our seasonal workers.  The COVID-19 pandemic  We are acutely aware that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to bring an increased risk of modern slavery in some industries and some organisations within the Agricultural sector. We understand that the situation is everchanging and that there could still be further potential impacts on the food sector supply chain. We can confirm that to date, the following information remains the case for our Company:   - Agrii’s own recruitment and staffing demand has been unaffected by the pandemic. BREXIT added an additional challenge with some seasonal workers from overseas no longer being available, however we managed to recruit all positions successfully or relied more on existing internal resource.  - Agrii has supported its own employees by being flexible with working hours, working practices, working from home and offering wellbeing advice.  - Agrii chose not to furlough any of its employees and has fully supported both the return to offices when we were able to do so, and more recently supported employees with our current ‘work from home’ guidance. We have adopted new ways of working where possible, most notably with video calls, conferences and demonstration events in place of in-person meetings.  - All sites and meetings continue to be risk-assessed as required with regular briefings to all employees on COVID-19 controls / measures in place and provision of PPE to protect against COVID-19 risks in workplaces.  - There have been no indications or evidence to suggest that our supply chain has suffered from an increased risk of modern slavery.  - Agrii’s payment of suppliers has not suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with our usual supplier invoices being paid on time and in full.  - We’ve continued to work with our new and existing suppliers to confirm they understand and accept Agrii’s position on modern slavery and sign up to our core principles on modern slavery. We track responses from suppliers, as one key metric, to assist in determining the effectiveness of our efforts to ensure our supply chain is free from modern slavery and human trafficking.  Other existing procedures  As well as the above measures, we will also continue to take the following steps to ensure that we further combat slavery and human trafficking:  • Provide an opportunity for all employees to identify risks anonymously through a (externally provided) whistleblowing process which is detailed on the Company intranet and communicated in our modern slavery policy  • Continue our internal ‘risk checks’ to ensure that any permanent or seasonal employment (within our 800-900 workforce, based at various sites within the UK including our production facilities) does not contravene our own ethical standards or any legislation or government guidance  • Commit to promptly answer questions posed by our customers (predominantly farmers and growers) in respect of the MSA who wish to know more about our operations and / or our supply chain  • Continue to monitor and review our MSA processes, ensuring that we are also keeping up to date with proposed government amendments to the legislation.
