Policies The Organisation has the following policies which further define its stance on modern slavery  • Modern Slavery Statement  Definitions The Organisation considers that modern slavery encompasses:  • human trafficking • forced work, through mental or physical threat • being owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse or the threat of abuse • being dehumanised, treated as a commodity or being bought or sold as property • Being physically constrained or to have restriction placed on freedom of movement.  Commitment The Organisation acknowledges its responsibilities in relation to tackling modern slavery and commits to complying with the provisions in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Organisation understands that this requires an ongoing review of both its internal practices in relation to its labour force and, additionally, its supply chains.              The Organisation does not enter into business with any other organisation, in the United Kingdom or abroad, which knowingly supports or is found to involve itself in slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour.   No labour provided to the Organisation in the pursuance of the provision of its own services is obtained by means of slavery or human trafficking. The Organisation strictly adheres to the minimum standards required in relation to its responsibilities under relevant employment legislation in United Kingdom.  The Organisation has a whistle blowing policy in place which applies to all employees, agency staff, contractors, subcontractors, agents, suppliers or any other person associated with the Organisation. Any concerns reported will be investigated thoroughly.   Supply chains In order to fulfil its activities, the company worked with approximately 400 suppliers in the last 12 months, 85.5% are domestic, 10% European and 5.5% from outside the European Economic Area.   Potential exposure The Organisation considers its main exposure to the risk of slavery and human trafficking exists in its supply chains because they involve the provision of labour in countries where protection against breaches of human rights may be limited.   In general, the Organisation considers its exposure to slavery/human trafficking to be relatively limited as it has taken steps to ensure that such practices do not take place in its business nor the business of any organisation that supplies goods and/or services to it.   Steps The Organisation carries out due diligence processes in relation to ensuring slavery and/or human trafficking does not take place in its organisation or supply chains, including conducting a review of the controls of its suppliers.  The Organisation has not, to its knowledge, conducted any business with another organisation which has been found to have involved itself with modern slavery.  In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Organisation has taken the following steps to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place:    • Implementing the supplier assessment questionnaire ensures measures are in place to identify and assess the potential risks in our supply chains • undertaking impact assessments of our services upon potential instances of slavery • creating action plans to address risk to modern slavery • Embed a zero-tolerance policy towards modern slavery in any of its supply chains and in any part of its own organisation • Conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all employees to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will • Modern Slavery Statement provided to employees.              Key performance indicators The Organisation has set key performance indicators to measure its effectiveness in ensuring modern slavery is not taking place in the Organisation or its supply chains.  (Within the organisation the company complies with the national minimum wage and national living wage legislation for the employees and we verify each supplier against their own policies and procedures and via conducing a “supplier assessment questionnaire” SAQ).  Responsibility for the policy Ultimate responsibility for the prevention of modern slavery rests with the Company’s leadership. The board of Directors of the Company has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy and its implementation comply with the legal and ethical obligations. Managers at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern slavery.    Reporting concerns about Modern Slavery or Human Trafficking Concerns about suspected modern slavery associated with the Organisation or our suppliers may be reported in confidence by employees to our QA Team  who will then determine the Organisation’s next course of action, or the Modern Slavery Helpline on 0800 0121 700 or https://modernslavery.co.uk/contact.html.
