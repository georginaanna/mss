We understand that as a labour provider the risk of human trafficking and exploitation of our workers from external sources is high.      First Call Contract Services have identified that the main risks of exploitation affecting our business is from external individuals and or organised gangs introducing workers both in person and anonymously. This often incorporates the controlling of bank accounts and the finances of the victims.  Through the Stronger Together Initiative, we have established a set of Alert Flags to highlight potential cases of exploitation within our branches and onsite locations. We have also set in place a specific interview question template which is used during colleague registrations to identify likely cases of trafficking and/or exploitation at an early stage. The Compliance Director conducts an annual review of our Modern Slavery Prevention processes to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. An action plan is then formed from the results and improvements are made where necessary. Independent assessments are conducted by Stronger Together every three years to monitor the company’s progress in relation to the implementation of measures to prevent modern slavery. First Call Contract Services have recruited a Modern Slavery Champion who supports the Compliance Team in delivering the organisations Modern Slavery prevention and awareness program.   Branch Managers conduct a monthly compliance check of their own branches, looking for multiple use of addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other indicators of exploitation. In addition, the Compliance Team check bank accounts for multiple use. Should non-conformances be identified, corrective actions are issued, and preventative measures are put in place. However, if evidence of Modern Slavery is found, it is then investigated by the Compliance Team and reported to the relevant bodies.  First Call Contract Services have implemented a comprehensive auditing regime. All branches and on-site contracts are audited on a regular basis by the Compliance Team using the ALP’s Complyer Audit tool and the following points are covered: • Registration Process (Form Completion) • Right to Work • Work History • Multiple Occupancy of Addresses • Multiple Use of Bank Accounts • Multiple Use of Phone Numbers • Multiple Use of Email Addresses • Payroll (Timesheets; Payslips) • Worker Interviews/Workshops • Manager and Consultant Discussions • ETI Base Code  All internal audit results are presented to the Board of Directors.  We are audited regularly by our clients and furthermore, contribute to our client’s own supply chain audits.
