A zero tolerance approach to modern slavery in any form is a moral imperative for our company and we support the goal of reducing the exploitation of individuals at the hands of others. Throughout our operations, we seek to avoid complicity in human rights abuses and to uphold relevant international standards.With more than 17,200 talented employees operating in 37 countries, we recognise that we have a responsibility to respect the dignity, liberty and equality of everyone with whom we work and of all of the people in the communities in which we operate.Viterra is pleased to share this modern slavery statement for 2021, which outlines our approach to mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business operations and supply chains.David Mattiske Chief Executive OfficerWe are committed to upholding human rights, wherever in the world we work.A message from our Chief Executive OfficerKey modern slavery actions 2021• We received no reported human rights including modern slavery breaches in 2021 through our various channels• We have reviewed and realigned this statement with our approach to modern slavery to provide more information for the audience• We completed our internal human rights impact assessment survey to identify, understand and assess the potential human rights threats present within our own business and supply chains• We have extended awareness of our human rights policy which was introduced in 2020• We added modern slavery clauses in certain contracts in 2021 and we intend to add similar clauses to additional contracts in 2022.Modern slavery statement 20213Modern slavery statement 2021About this statement and our structureThis is our fourth modern slavery statement published in accordance with the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 and our second in accordance with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018.The information set out in this statement is provided as a consolidated description for the Viterra Group, except where information is identified as relevant to specific reporting entities within the group.

We have zero tolerance towards any form of forced labour, child labour, physical assault or harassment within our workplace.We are aware that agricultural supply chains and the vast number of suppliers involved can include products associated with human rights related risks including modern slavery. Based on information from agriculture industry reviews and our internal assessment, potential human rights related risks include:• the use of child labour• the use of forced labour• purchasing grain commodities from suppliers in countries and regions where labour rights may not be protected or where employers may utilise vulnerable low-skilled workers• the impact on communities and their traditional livelihoods due to: monoculture; land use for cash crops; volume of water use; and the impact of effluent and wastes• forced resettlement of communities, including indigenous peoples• transporting goods over land and ocean with an associated risk of human trafficking through the black market• discrimination of people.Modern slavery statement 202110Our approach to modern slavery risks includes:• our policies• implementation, training and awareness• identification and due diligence• collaboration and stakeholder engagement.Our policiesOur policies are our first step in our approach to addressing modern slavery. We have established a comprehensive suite of policies for both internal and external use available on our website, and internal use only which are available in multiple languages and available to employees on our internal systems.Our policies are developed and owned by the relevant department(s) and are signed off before being published/rolled out.Actions and due diligence  to address modern slavery risksModern slavery statement 202111Modern slavery statement 2021Actions and due diligence  to address modern slavery risksPolicy or documentRelevance to modern slaveryHow it is availableStatement of valuesOur values include how we are responsible for people and communities, continuously looking to improve our performance.They explain that we are true to our word and partner with customers in a positive way operating with transparency and integrity.They also state how we make things happen and empower our people to make well-informed decisions.Viterra.com, internal systems and introductory trainingCode of conductOur code of conduct applies to everyone working for Viterra, in all locations and across all functions. All employees contractors, directors and officers are expected to understand the code and apply it to each of our roles and responsibilities.It includes information on raising concerns, our people, human rights and communities.Our code encompasses information from our policies including our zero tolerance for forced labour and child labour in our workplace or along our supply chains, and our commitment to paying at least minimum wages in accordance with local regulations.Viterra.com, internal systems and introductory trainingGlobal anti-corruption policyOur global anti-corruption policy applies to all employees and sets out our expectations for everyone in our business to subscribe to the Viterra culture. Our culture requires employees to abide by the highest ethical standards at all times irrespective of subtleties of legal interpretation in different countries.This policy informs colleagues on the various forms in which bribery and corruption can take place, and how to identify and report suspected breaches of this policy.Viterra.com, internal systems and annual trainingHuman rights policyThis policy applies to all Viterra employees and contractors and states our fundamental commitment to respect human rights consistent with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.It includes our zero tolerance towards any form of workplace discrimination, forced labour, child labour, physical assault or harassment within our workplace or along our supply chains.Viterra.com and  internal systemsHSEC policyOur health, safety, environment and community (HSEC) policy is underpinned by our values and our approach to sustainability.It states how we uphold human rights and support the long-term development of the local communities in which we operate.This policy is available to all employees through the Viterra intranet and is visually displayed at appropriate locations.Internal systemsClick to viewClick to viewClick to viewClick to viewOur policiesModern slavery statement 202112Implementation, training and awarenessImplementation, training and awareness is key in addressing modern slavery risks since policies only matter to the extent they are put into practice. Our training empowers and guides employees on how they should approach and raise potential breaches of modern slavery so we can address them.Similarly to our policies, our training packages are developed and owned by the relevant department(s), records of all completed training sessions undertaken by employees are maintained by the appropriate compliance or human resources contact.Both our employees and contractors are required to complete annual training which covers, amongst other subjects, Viterra’s approach to upholding human rights, our code of conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, conflict of interest and sanctions.Code of conduct trainingOn a yearly basis, we provide our employees with training on Viterra’s code of conduct, which includes our approach to respecting and upholding human rights throughout our operations. Specifically mentioned in the code, is Viterra’s zero tolerance for any form of forced labour or child labour in our supply chains, and our commitment to paying at least minimum wages in accordance with local regulations.In most instances, the training is completed via an e-learning platform. Where employees are not easily able to access online training, we provide guidance in other ways including pre-shift general training and toolbox talks. Additionally, where relevant, our compliance teams give face-to-face training on our compliance policies and procedures to raise awareness about compliance risks related to their functions.Viterra requires employees who have responsibility for ensuring the implementation of human rights to undergo further training aligned with international standards if relevant. We operate grievance mechanisms for our stakeholders throughout our operations.Human rights policy trainingWe published our Human rights policy in 2021 which lays out our commitment to respecting human rights and is consistent with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In relation to modern slavery, this document specifically lists Viterra’s zero tolerance for forced labour and child labour in our workplace or along our supply chains.The policy was sent to all employees with work email addresses globally, and in Australia, training on the policy was added to the code of conduct training package.Raising concernsEmployees also receive training on raising concerns which includes our expectation that we are informed of any situation in which the Viterra code of conduct, its underlying policies or the law appear to be breached. They may raise the concern with their supervisor or manager, an appropriate manager from another department, their local compliance contact or by utilising our raising concerns programme (explained on page 14).Sustainability reportWe have published our annual sustainability report since 2018. The report details our commitment and progress in health and safety, environment, community, human rights and food and feed safety.It also includes case studies detailing initiatives within our global business across all these topics.Modern slavery statement 202113Modern slavery statement 2021Actions and due diligence  to address modern slavery risksIdentification and due diligenceWe have a philosophy of giving responsibility to individuals within Viterra, with that responsibility comes the obligation to act ethically and report human rights breaches including modern slavery through our mechanisms.Our due diligence processes have been designed with reference to key human rights standards and enable us to help mitigate modern slavery risk in our supply chain.Raising Concerns programmeIf one of our people believes they have encountered a breach of policy, including human rights and modern slavery, we encourage them to raise it promptly with their supervisor or manager. Alternatively, the individual may bring it to the attention of another manager, a local compliance contact, or a member of Viterra’s business ethics committee, which is made up of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Global Head of Compliance.However, if they feel their concern remains unresolved or they wish to remain anonymous we provide our Raising Concerns programme where people can submit the matter.Anyone, whether from our business or not, can use the programme to raise a concern. It provides different contact options and considers local conditions, languages and ease of use with telephone and online platforms.Viterra does not penalise anyone for raising a concern in good faith, including demotion, penalty or any other disciplinary action.The Raising Concerns programme is advertised and promoted via dedicated training and visual material, such as posters, available throughout work sites. It was relaunched in 2020 following the global rebrand from Glencore Agriculture to Viterra. New posters were delivered to all sites in our network including Australia and the UK.There were 91 concerns raised through our Raising Concerns platform in 2021 and investigated by our compliance team, none of which were modern slavery related.Know your counterparty procedureKnow your counterparty identifies and verifies counterparties Viterra engages with, checking for any red flags such as money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, bribery, sanctions and human rights violations.Across our global business there are requirements to screen counterparties and our know your counterparty procedure has been altered specifically for different regions based on their supply chains and risk levels. There is a global screening system available and local checks can also be carried out.Supplier due diligence in our soy supply chainsWe incorporate a georeferencing farm monitoring system into our Brazilian soy procurement operations to monitor suppliers.The system monitors soy suppliers and their farms for relevant environmental, social and legal information. It combines up-to-date imagery sources with data from sources such as embargoes of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the Amazon Protection System, Green Protocol of Grains at Pará state, Amazon Soy Moratorium and Modern Slavery.Suppliers who do not meet the minimum requirements are flagged and we carry out a deeper analysis. We will guide the supplier on how to improve or we may decide not to work with the supplier if the issue shows they do not comply with our Soy sustainability policy for South America or any other socio-environmental requirements.If a modern slavery risk is detected with a supplier, our zero tolerance policy means we would cease working with them straight away. Modern slavery statement 202114Collaboration and stakeholder engagementWe believe collaboration with our suppliers, business partners and industry, and non-government and government organisations is required to make real and effective change in addressing modern slavery risks. We are focused on ensuring our suppliers understand our zero tolerance policy on human rights and modern slavery breaches. In Australia, we have added modern slavery clauses to our design and construct contract and our consultancy agreement with a plan to add a similar clause to more contracts for 2022.We evidence our commitment through our participation in international conventions, including the United Nations Global Compact, a set of principles covering human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and the standards set out by the International Labour Organization (ILO).Viterra is a member of many organisations and standards organisations providing opportunities for shared learnings and valuable insights to inform our response to modern slavery and broader human rights issues.We worked or collaborated with the following organisations during 2021:United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)Viterra has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) since 2018, an organisation which calls on its members to align their operations with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As a member, Viterra pledges to implement changes to business operations and strategy, incorporating the Ten Principles of the UNGC.Viterra also supports the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) which are mapped to our sustainability pillars.This includes:SDG 8 – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Target 8.7 – Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE)Viterra is associated with ABIOVE, which represents companies who produce meal, vegetable oils and biodiesel in Brazil and cooperates in the implementation of sector policies, promotes sustainability programmes and generates the statistics used in sectorial studies.Since 2006, the soy production chain has adopted a zero tolerance policy towards labour conditions analogous to slavery. This includes a contractual clause in soy purchases whereby they can terminate trade agreements if there is evidence of abusive labour in their supply chain.ABIOVE defends the commitment not to trade soy produced on properties with deforested areas, or those embargoed by environmental monitoring entities or included in the list of slave labour. As part of this focus, it is a signatory of the National Pact for Eradication of Slave Labour – Instituto Ethos, International Labour Organization (ILO), Repórter Brasil, and the Pará State Grain Protocol. Through our work with ABIOVE we also support InPACTO which is a non-governmental organisation with the mission to promote the prevention and eradication of slave labour in production chains in Brazil.Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS)Viterra is a member of RTRS Production Standard which aims to guarantee responsible business and agricultural practices by preserving biodiversity, soil and water, protecting human and workers’ rights, respecting the customs and cultures of indigenous peoples and improving the wellbeing of local communities.Modern slavery statement 202115Modern slavery statement 2021Actions and due diligence  to address modern slavery risksBetter Cotton Initiative (BCI)BCI supports farmers by helping them understand and respect national legal requirements, as well as the fundamental, interrelated International Labour Organization conventions on respecting the minimum age for young workers and avoiding child labour. BCI does not accept forced and child labour on cotton farms, including where orchestrated by government. If BCI discovers these practices where its cotton is produced, BCI considers it non-compliant with its standards and responds immediately.Cotton made in Africa (CmiA)CmiA’s high standards strictly prohibit child labour outside of a family context, any form of exploitative child labour or where a child’s health or development may be harmed. CmiA does not consider prohibition enough on its own, it also actively seeks to combat child labour through local education work, school projects for children from farming families, and measures designed to increase family incomes.CmiA significantly contributes to improving the living conditions of smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa by aiding trade. In addition, participation in the programme also forbids slavery and human trafficking according to international labour standards on child labour conventions, deforestation of primary forests, or the use of genetically modified cotton.Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)RSPO prohibits the use of forced labour. Its members aim to influence change through initiatives that bring industry participants together to elevate the protection of human rights and ensure the sustainable production of palm oil.BonsucroMuch of the world’s sugarcane is grown in countries where working conditions are poor. Bonsucro aims to drive and support decent work for smallholder farmers and farm and mill workers, with zero tolerance for forced labour and child labour. It ensures safe recruitment for migrant workers and reduces discrimination in all its forms. Modern slavery statement 202116Viterra is committed to being part of sustainable change, including the elimination of modern slavery within agricultural supply chains.Though we had no reported human rights breaches in 2021 through our various channels, we acknowledge the need for further action across the industry and are working to further advance how we address modern slavery risks in our business.We completed our internal human rights impact assessment to identify, understand and assess the potential human rights threats present within our own business and supply chains. The results were collated and a report tabled with the sustainability committee. The assessment identified there are no material human rights risks within our business or supply chains. While there is no specific actions to be taken as an outcome of the assessment, human rights is an ever present risk and something we will continue to monitor and explore potential forward looking actions.Our supplier code of conduct is in development. It will detail the requirements and expectations we have for all our suppliers based on internationally accepted standards, as well as our values, code of conduct and our policies including our global anti-corruption and human rights policies.Assessing the effectiveness of our actionsModern slavery statement 202117Modern slavery statement 2021DisclaimerThis document contains statements that are, or may be deemed to be, “forward looking statements” which are prospective in nature.
