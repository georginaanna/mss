Progress was made towards a number of the commitments made in last year’s statement, details of which are below:   • Good progress has been made with the Supplier Code of Conduct, ensuring all of our new suppliers sign up whilst simultaneously working through our legacy suppliers. It is worth noting that our Portuguese and Spanish operations have made particular advances in this area   • Engagement with SEDEX throughout 2021 continued. SEDEX training webinars were attended by colleagues from Technical, Procurement and Human Resources.  SEDEX also helped to facilitate sessions to help Vitacress colleagues develop an understanding of the tools available to support with the risk assessment of our supply base   • Throughout 2021, Vitacress continued to participate in the Stronger Together Advanced Business Partner programme. Overall, there was an improvement in our scores across the six categories measured in relation to modern slavery controls and risk  management.   • Standard questions have been devised and are in use for auditing and visit purposes. Further development and roll-out is planned   • Vitacress has adopted a new methodology to monitor Human Rights due diligence  within our own operations and supply chains   • Modern Slavery KPIs have been included in the monthly Operating Board Governance pack. Areas of concern are highlighted, with any corrective actions discussed  • Vitacress Espana, Vitacress Salads and Vitacress Herbs all had an on-site SMETA audit during 2021.   • The company-wide colleague satisfaction survey was delayed and re-scheduled for 2022 1. Our organisational  structure   Vitacress is a European-wide business that has a variety of farming and manufacturing sites across several countries. In the UK, Vitacress has two manufacturing sites, supported by two leaf and four watercress farms. Outside the UK, Vitacress has manufacturing sites in Portugal and the Netherlands, two farming areas in Portugal and one farm in Spain.   Business Supply Chains  Vitacress is committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct and social and environmental responsibility. Vitacress requires suppliers to operate in accordance with the principles of its  Supplier Code of Conduct and in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and codes within their countries of operation. Our Supplier Code of Conduct highlights the minimum          requirements expected of a supplier to Vitacress and as such may be augmented by the law and by higher standards of expectations as set out in any contract between a supplier and Vitacress.   Vitacress’ Purchasing Policies also provide clear guidelines, committing every individual involved in purchasing and supply management processes to use their best endeavours to ensure that our purchasing and contracting activities are aligned with our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement.   Geographic sources  Vitacress sources both raw material and non-raw materials from suppliers around the world  directly and indirectly.  Suppliers we have a trading relationship with and source directly from (first tier) are located in the following countries:  Belgium, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Lithuania, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand,  United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States of America.

Our policies in relation to modern slavery   Our policies and codes of practice support Vitacress’ opposition to all forms of human rights abuse and take into account local, national and international laws and regulation.   UK  All policies and codes of practice have been reviewed by our legal advisors during 2021 and changes made where relevant to maintain compliance and best practice. Policies and codes of practice form part of the induction pack for colleagues and are also available on the Company intranet.  Policies • Modern Slavery  • Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation/Stronger Together • Agency Labour Provider • Human Rights - Equal Opportunities and Dignity at Work • Young Person and Child Worker • Grievance • Whistleblowing • Recruitment  • Anti-Bribery • Group Purchasing Policy   Codes of Practice • Employee Code of Conduct • Supplier Code of Conduct  Vitacress Portugal/Vitacress Real (The Netherlands)  As part of induction, the onboarding documentation and colleague handbook contains the following: • Employee Code of Conduct • Whistleblowing • Recruitment  • Grievance • Anti-Bribery • Equal Opportunities  In addition, Vitacress Real manages labour provision through the ABU (General Federation  Temporary Employment Agencies), which ensures affiliates comply with the law and are subject to annual audits.   As required by Dutch law, whistleblowing and grievance procedures are supported by independent counsellors. Vitacress Real has appointed two counsellors as described in the colleague handbook.  Vitacress Espana Our policies and codes of practice in Spain have been translated from the UK versions and adjusted to take account of local law. We work with two local independent labour law experts to ensure  compliance. 3. Due diligence  Vitacress SMETA Audit Status (Manufacturing)  All Vitacress sites are registered on the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange platform (SEDEX), and the manufacturing sites have SMETA audits. During 2021, Vitacress Salads, Vitacress Herbs and Vitacress Espana were routinely audited, with minimal or no non-conformances.  Supplier Due Diligence The main tool used for ethical risk assessment for UK operations supply is SEDEX. All raw material, ingredients, packaging and labour providers are registered on the SEDEX platform. As such, there is a requirement to complete a self-assessment questionnaire, and initiate a trading relationship on the platform with the relevant Vitacress business.  The business units hold a monthly review of registered suppliers using the SEDEX risk assessment tool (RADAR) which highlights the risk category for each registered supplier. Those falling in to the red or high risk category are then subject to further investigation to establish whether the risk  factors are inherent such as country or region of operation or the factors relate to business  management controls. Dependent on the findings, a SMETA audit or site visit may be required to address risks and establish corrective action.  Our operations in Europe use a number of tools to aid ethical assessment, subject to customer  requirements, Local laws and Vitacress practices. These include SEDEX, GLOBALG.A.P Risk  Assessment on Social Practice (GRASP) and the Vitacress Supplier Code of Conduct.  There has been good progress across all European operations with the Supplier Code of Conduct roll out across all areas of the businesses, and all raw material suppliers have signed and agreed to the terms of the code.  Verification  Through 2021, Vitacress Salads team have piloted a proactive approach to working with suppliers in the higher risk category. This has resulted in the reduction in number of suppliers classed as high risk by utilising our in-house expertise to support the supply base and helping them identify where action is required to improve the risk assessment outcome.  Annual assessments for raw material, ingredient or packaging suppliers have continued. The  technical warranty packs have been reviewed and updated for raw material and ingredient  suppliers, and together with the Supplier Code of Conduct and SEDEX registration are issued and agreed annually.  Labour providers must have a Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) license to provide agency workers. They must also be registered on SEDEX and be subject to an annual audit. This was maintained throughout 2021, although with Coronavirus restrictions some of these were re-mote audits. Vitacress utilised the UK Government Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme for our farms in 2021, sourcing workers via an approved provider, which we audited prior to activation.   Audits  All stages of Vitacress operations, supply chain and labour provision can be subject to programmed or unannounced audit to ensure compliance to Vitacress expected standards.  During 2021, audits and visits went ahead as scheduled, adjusting to the restrictions caused by the pandemic as  necessary.  Vitacress Real labour provider has been audited as required by local law. 4. Assessing and  managing risk  Vitacress continues to operate within the framework of our policies and codes of practice, enabling the business to carry out risk assessment and due diligence as necessary.  Risk assessment within UK operations is supported by AB (supplier/buyer) membership of SEDEX and where necessary, SMETA auditing.  Raw material sourcing can include products from countries classed as high risk in terms of  potential human rights abuses. To support risk assessment and due diligence, all programmed raw material suppliers must be registered on SEDEX. Where higher risk factors are indicated, a SMETA audit is required and any non-conformances identified must be closed out in the appropriate  timescales. Results of SMETA audits are reviewed by the relevant site team and any further action deemed necessary is taken. This may involve site visits, support with documentation and policies or verification via a follow-up audit.  The raw material supply base risk management within European operations is supported by the Supplier Code of Conduct. Further assessment is accessed via SEDEX or GRASP audits, with the latter requiring an annual audit. Raw material supplier visits are scheduled as necessary.  Use of other information sources such as Stronger Together, Association of Labour Providers (ALP) newsletter and customer communications all support a wider network of industry intelligence to identify risk in business supply chains.  The Group Technical Director has attended two Modern Slavery Intelligence Network working groups, focussing on the risks within the food industry and the sharing of best practice and ideas.          5. Measuring performance    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  • Vitacress continued throughout 2021 as a Stronger Together Advance Business partner. Year- on-year there has been an improvement in all risk categories, and the business scores higher  than average in each category. Particular improvement has been evidenced in the ‘Acting to reduce Modern Slavery Risks’ category, and the Company continues to perform well in the ‘Commitment’ section • The Operating Board review Modern Slavery risks on a monthly basis as part of the business  governance KPIs • The UK business units review SEDEX registration and risk assessment results monthly, with a  focus on the higher risk rated suppliers • Audit results are reviewed as they occur and at the monthly governance forum. Any action      including site visits will be taken as required  • Whistleblowing incidents and other activities that may indicate modern slavery factors are  discussed at the appropriate business forum        6. Training and raising awareness in 2021 Vitacress has a training programme to ensure every colleague is made aware of the risks of  modern slavery from the moment they start working with the company. Courses focused on modern slavery are run in person and via webinars, as detailed below:    Course  Training Provider  No. Colleagues Purchasing Practices Refresher  Internal Stronger Together 8 x Procurement Tackling Modern Day Slavery External Stronger Together Internal 3 x Human Resources 3 x Technical Team Tackling Modern Day Slavery -  Guidance and Worker Induction for Farm Managers Internal 13 x Production Team Colleague Inductions Internal 455 x Colleagues Colleague Refresher Induction Internal 5 x Colleagues Tackling Modern Day Slavery for Managers Internal 13 x Managers Tackling Modern Day Slavery for  Managers Refresher Internal 29 x Managers Modern Slavery Champion  Steering Group Internal  11 Colleagues HRDD Steering Group Formed Internal 6 x Colleagues  Webinars   Training Provider  No. Colleagues Responsible Recruitment Update & Update Forums ALP/ Stronger Together 2 x Human Resources Immigration Systems &  Rights to Work after the Grace Period External—ALP 1 x Human Resources Effectively Sourcing and  Retaining Workers External—ALP 2 x Human Resources Mitigating Modern Slavery in  Risks In Labour Providers.

Meetings  There are various forums through which we constantly review any issues, the risks and due  diligence measures around the subject.  The Vitacress Operating Board meets monthly and discusses Modern Slavery KPIs as part of the Company governance agenda across all business areas.  Each business unit reviews Modern Slavery measures and KPIs with the senior management team monthly.  Modern Slavery is an agenda item on the monthly Group HR meeting.  Modern Slavery is an agenda item on the bi-monthly Business Involvement Groups (BIG), which have cross business worker representation (UK).  Vitacress UK also makes available an employee assistance programme (through Aviva), whereby anyone can email or phone the free 24-hour confidential help line for support and advice. The phone numbers are displayed on all company notice boards and the company intranet (UK).   Communications  Posters in various languages are visible in several places across each manufacturing location and at our farms and our policies are easily accessible on our company intranet.  To create further awareness, an anti-slavery day campaign was run across the UK in October 2021. Emails were sent out to the Senior Leadership Teams with information to share with their teams, including a video of things to look out for. Digital wallpaper on each laptop/computer was displayed with a digital signpost to look out for further information on the company intranet.      Looking forward  Areas of Focus for 2022  • Build on the Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) framework adopted in 2021 through        formation of work stream to promote this approach throughout our business operations and         first-tier suppliers • As SEDEX develops the tools and audits for enhanced management of the supply chain risk,       Vitacress will participate in focus groups and training to adopt new practices and implement       improved assessment techniques • Utilisation of new audit tools for assessment of labour providers, ensuring best practice. This       will include increasing worker welfare checks • Inclusion of further governance factors in the Operating Board monthly reports relating to       Modern Slavery risks • Utilisation of the ALP Right to Work checklist within recruitment • Investigate local Modern Slavery groups for victim support • Further rollout of the UK Salads team pilot which supports suppliers classified as high risk       within the SEDEX platform and helps to reduce their risk factors • Conduct business-wide colleague survey • Create Modern Slavery action plans for raw material and other non-produce material through  the appropriate business leads    Training Focus for 2022  • Tackling Modern Slavery in UK Businesses – Bespoke course for Directors and Senior  management. • Tackling Modern Slavery e-Learning to include Compliance Recruiter Principles – Internal for Managers and Supervisors throughout the business. • Modern Slavery Champion Steering Group – External - for the Champion Group. • Responsible Recruitment Toolkit Training – External - Recruitment Team. • HRDD Group – CPD Training – External.  • Best Practice for Handling Suspected or Reported Cases of Forced Labour - External for the HR Teams.  Our commitment Across all our businesses we will continue to add new initiatives, processes and partnerships to  reduce the risks of slavery and human trafficking.
