At GrainCorp, this means doing business in a way that acknowledges and respects the rights of our people, customers, suppliers and contractors, to be free from practices of modern slavery, including forced labour, human trafficking and child labour.In FY22, GrainCorp continued to embed our approach to identifying and addressing Modern Slavery in our supply chain. Key highlights include: –elevating Human Rights, as part of our overall ESG governance, to Board level, through the establishment of a new Board Sustainability Committee. –publishing a new Human Rights Position Statement to publicly commit to respecting internationally recognised human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the fundamental principles and rights at work as outlined in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. –expanding our membership of Sedex to connect with our suppliers and better understand Modern Slavery risk in our supply chain, with a particular focus on our palm oil suppliers. –evaluating our Supplier Code of Conduct against industry best practice to identify improvement opportunities that have been incorporated into a new Supplier Code of Conduct for progressive roll-out in FY23.  –conducting a Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audit (‘SMETA’) over our Numurkah, Victoria, Foods processing plant, completing the review of our three primary Foods processing facilities in Australia and New Zealand with no labour standard non-conformances identified.In FY23, GrainCorp will continue to assess our supply chains to identify inputs deemed high-risk and develop appropriate sourcing policies and protocols, and I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress in future Modern Slavery Statements.This Statement has been reviewed and approved by the Board of GrainCorp Limited in its own capacity and on behalf of the entities that GrainCorp Limited owns or controls that are reporting entities for the purposes of the Act.Robert Spurway Managing Director & CEO 16 November 20224GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTCALGARYSINGAPOREBANGKOKHO CHI MINHWINNIPEGSWAFFHAMTADCASTERKYIVDELHIBEIJINGSHANGHAITAURANGANAPIERTIMARUBLUFFAUCKLANDNEWPLYMOUTHMACKAYGLADSTONEBRISBANENEWCASTLEPORT KEMBLAPERTHPORTLANDSYDNEYNUMURKAHGEELONGMELBOURNEMAYMONTVEGREVILLEREFORDHUXLEYFRASER GRAIN TERMINAL(PORT OF VANCOUVER) ^GrainCorp Limited is a public company, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. We are a diversified Australian agribusiness, with integrated operations spanning four continents and a proud history of delivering for our customers for more than 100 years. Our StructureGrainCorp employs ~1,828 people across Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, Ukraine, Singapore, India, China, Thailand and Vietnam. Our operations are primarily conducted through our consolidated Group of companies, including Saxon Agriculture in the UK.In Canada, GrainCorp also own supply chain assets connecting growers in the Prairies to international customers via the port of Vancouver through GrainsConnect Canada, GrainCorp’s 50–50 joint venture with Zen-Noh Grain Corporation.GrainCorp has acted in consultation with the GrainCorp group subsidiaries covered by this Statement which it controls, are fully consolidated entities of the Group, and whose revenue exceeds the reporting threshold in FY22.

See our network map  grains.graincorp.com.au/locations/5GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTGrainCorp partners with growers to maximise the value of their crops, connecting them to domestic and global marketplaces through our end-to-end supply chain and infrastructure assets. We develop innovative solutions to create high quality and sustainable products across the food, feed and industrial sectors.East Coast Australia (ECA)GrainCorp’s ECA business is an integrated grain storage and handling network spread across the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, comprising over 160 regional receival sites and seven bulk port terminals. Principal activities involve purchasing, storing, transporting, and selling agricultural commodities while managing risk across the value chain. For transportation services, we either lease the road/rail assets or contract with third parties. The main commodities that we handle are wheat, barley, canola, chickpeas and sorghum. We also utilise our port terminals to import/export bulk materials including woodchips, fertiliser, sand, sugar and cement.GrainCorp acts as both an owner/marketer of commodities and as a third-party service provider through its asset ownership. For the provision of services, GrainCorp charges fees at various stages of the supply chain, for receival, out-loading, storage, transport, blending, port booking and vessel loading. Where GrainCorp is marketing grain or oilseeds to a customer, it takes a position to seek to capture a margin between prices paid to growers and prices received from customers. Derivatives are used to hedge long and short positions.Revenue and profits in grain marketing are subject to variability in grain production, prices, the position taken and risk management processes. Ownership of supply chain infrastructure is a competitive advantage as it enables GrainCorp to reliably source supply, provide customers with consistent quality, manage logistics more effectively, and have coordinated access to storage facilities.InternationalGrainCorp’s International business originates grain and oilseeds from regions outside of ECA – i.e. South Australia, Western Australia, South America, Ukraine, Canada and United Kingdom – and connects these commodities to customers in 50+ countries. A core objective for the business is to have diversity of supply, which enables GrainCorp to service its customers reliably on a year-round basis.The International business utilises GrainCorp supply chains where possible, and in some jurisdictions it utilises third-party storage, handling and transportation infrastructure to connect grain to customers.GrainCorp’s UK business, Saxon Agriculture, specialises in the trade, import and export of cereals, oilseeds and pulses and is a supplier of arable seeds and organic agriproducts in the UK.Feeds, Fats & Oils FFO comprises several businesses across the animal feed and fats &  oils/agri-energy sectors in Australia and New Zealand.In Australia, GrainCorp’s Feeds business manufactures and supplies molasses-based feed supplements and vegetable oil to enhance farm productivity in beef cattle, sheep, dairy cattle and other domestic livestock. Its brands include Molafos, Rumifeed and Energro, as well as crude Molasses and Dry Feeds. In New Zealand, it sources local and imported feeds/ingredients to offer a range of liquid, in-shed, bulk dairy and calf feeds.GrainCorp’s ‘Fats & Oils’ (agri-energy) business involves the procurement, shipping, accreditation and value-added supply of tallow, vegetable oils and Used Cooking Oil (UCO). GrainCorp owns six bulk liquid terminals in New Zealand, Australia and China, and has strategic long-term access across multiple other sites in Australia. GrainCorp’s Auscol business also operates six UCO collection sites in Australia. Customers in this segment include fuel producers/refiners, quick service restaurants, industrial businesses and food manufacturers.OilseedsGrainCorp’s Oilseeds business sources canola seed from growers and accumulators in Australia to crush and create products including crude degummed oil, refined bleached oils and canola meal. GrainCorp’s oilseeds products are used in cooking oils, spreads and shortenings, prepared foods, meal for dairy, poultry and livestock, cosmetics and lubricants, fuels and other industrial applications. A key driver of earnings for the Oilseeds business is the crush margin, which is an aggregation of the revenue received for the oil and meal outputs minus the cost of the oilseed. The crush margin fluctuates depending on a range of factors, including the volume of Australian canola production (which impacts the cost of the oilseed), the volume of global production of canola and other oilseeds, and global and domestic demand for vegetable oils and canola meal.FoodsGrainCorp Foods produces a range of edible oils, infant nutrition, bakery margarines, spreads and shortening products at its three processing facilities in Victoria and Auckland, New Zealand. Customers range from multi-national and regional retail-branded food manufacturers to global quick service restaurants and family-owned local bakeries and hospitality outlets. GrainCorp’s product range includes vegetable spreads, premium cooking oil, pastry margarine, and bulk deliveries of blended oils. Over the past decade, Australian grown canola oil has become the oil of choice for many of GrainCorp’s Foods customers, with the trend becoming more pronounced in 2022 as certain customers chose to de-risk their exposure to overseas supply chains, switching from imported sunflower oil to local canola oil.Our Operations Further details on GrainCorp’s business, operating structure and joint ventures are outlined in our 2022 Annual Report, which is available via graincorp.com.au6GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTGrainCorp’s supply chains include the storage, transportation and processing of grains and oilseeds. They also facilitate the import and export of a range of commodities which are ingredients or other inputs in our value-added manufacturing operations or those of our customers.The main goods and services we source are: –Commodities from broadacre agriculture including grain and oilseeds (canola)  –Other commodities such as oils (palm, coconut, sunflower, soybean), tallow and UCO (Used Cooking Oil) –Variable labour to supplement the needs of the permanent workforce where we do not have an ongoing or fixed need for the labour, supplied through third-party employment agencies –Logistics (third-party logistics warehouses, road, rail and ocean freight) –Packaging and ingredients –Grain handling and food manufacturing equipment –Plant and equipment maintenance services including consumables, chemicals and processing aids –Bunker consumables (tarpaulins, fumigants) –Personal protective equipment, including clothing and footwear –Office-based support and equipment including IT hardware and systems, stationery, and cleaning services.GrainCorp procures a broad range of goods and services from several thousand suppliers across its operating regions of Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the UK and Ukraine.Our Supply Chains7GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTRisk is inherent in GrainCorp’s daily operations and the ability to achieve our goals depends heavily on how effectively risk is managed. GrainCorp’s risk management objective is to ensure all material risks are identified and measures are implemented to mitigate or otherwise manage those risks.In the context of GrainCorp’s objective to protect human rights in our operations and supply chain, and act ethically and with integrity in all business dealings, our approach to identifying modern slavery risk is integrated into our systematic approach to risk management.GrainCorp has commenced building an ESG Supplier Risk Assessment methodology to assess risks in our supply chain and identify the areas for immediate focus. The methodology assesses the product or service, operating location and supplier-specific information to form a risk rating. The methodology considers ESG risks relating to modern slavery, labour standards, health and safety, business ethics and environmental impacts using a range of globally recognised insights as a reference point for the risk assessment including the UN Human Rights Index, the Walk-Free Global Slavery Index and the Sedex Radar tool. As our responsible sourcing program develops, we will continue to refine and improve this screening process. In FY22, there were no material changes to GrainCorp’s operations and our exposure to modern slavery risk remains unchanged from the prior year, with a low risk of directly causing or contributing to modern slavery practices through our operations.The following potential risks have been identified in our supply chains:GrainCorp continues to consider modern slavery risks and the potential for the company (or its controlled entities) to cause, contribute or be directly or indirectly linked to modern slavery through our operations and supply chains on an ongoing basis. Vulnerable populationsUse of unskilled or temporary seasonal labour. For example, peak harvest periods and general agricultural harvest activities may involve higher risk of modern slavery practices in GrainCorp’s supply chains.Product and service categoriesCost pressures or delivery timeframes may have an unintended consequence of influencing suppliers to compromise on their labour conditions. Areas such as international logistics may be subject to such pressures.GeographiesOperating or maintaining relationships with suppliers in countries and industry sectors with reported evidence of human rights violations. The palm oil and textiles industry are two relevant sectors with higher risk of human rights violations.Identifying our Modern Slavery RiskSedex is a membership organisation that provides one of the world’s leading online platforms for companies to manage and improve working conditions in global supply chains. They provide practical tools to help companies improve their responsible and sustainable business practices, and source responsibly.  Further details on GrainCorp’s risk management framework are outlined in our Corporate Governance Statement graincorp.com.au8GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTHuman Rights Position StatementGrainCorp’s Human Rights Position Statement outlines our commitment to respecting internationally recognised human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We respect the fundamental principles and rights at work as outlined in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These include freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.We are progressively implementing effective systems and controls to understand, manage and minimise instances of modern slavery and human rights risks within our business and supply chain. The steps we are taking include: –Continued compliance with all applicable laws  –Embedding communication and training tools for our people and key stakeholders  –Implementing modern slavery risk assessment and management processes within our operations and supply chain and assessing the risks associated with our suppliers  –Implementing (and continuing to enhance) a Supplier Code of Conduct outlining the standards and principles we expect our suppliers to adhere to when conducting business with GrainCorp –Delivering public reporting under the Australian Modern Slavery Act (Cth) 2018 and the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) Our policies and statements on key human rights aspects include but are not limited to:  – Code of Conduct –Human Rights Position Statement –Supplier Code of Conduct –Palm Oil Position Statement – Group Whistleblower Policy  –Privacy Policy  – Diversity & Inclusion Policy  –Preventing Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace Policy Our Human Rights Position Statement, Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct together outline our commitments and expectations of suppliers when conducting business with GrainCorp and align with our values to ensure that we observe the highest standards of fair dealing, honesty and integrity in our business activities.We expect everyone who works at GrainCorp, including employees, directors and contractors, to understand, respect and uphold human rights within our business. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the standards and principles we expect of suppliers with respect to human rights.The Human Rights Position Statement also sets out the following reporting mechanisms for grievances available to our people, contractors and commercial partners: –Human Rights MailboxGrainCorp has established a mechanism whereby human rights grievances or concerns are able to be raised. Our people, contractors and commercial partners can access this mechanism by contacting GrainCorp at humanrights@graincorp.com.au or by phone  +61 2 9325 9108. These contact details are contained in GrainCorp’s Human Rights Position Statement which is publicly available on the Corporate Governance section of our website: graincorp.com.auThe mailbox is monitored daily by GrainCorp’s Compliance Unit and investigations are undertaken as required. –WhistleblowerGrainCorp has a dedicated Whistleblower hotline (FairCall) which is available to GrainCorp’s employees and those within our extended supply chains. Individuals can confidentially report breaches of any GrainCorp policy they may have observed or experienced, including concerns relating to modern slavery practices. GrainCorp’s Whistleblower Policy and contact details are available on the Corporate Governance section of our  website: graincorp.com.auPolicy and Governance9GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTGrainCorp Code of ConductGrainCorp’s Code of Conduct is founded on a set of defined values which guide how all GrainCorp employees should behave toward each other, our customers, other relevant stakeholders, the community and our environment. The Code of Conduct naturally requires compliance with all laws, and also goes beyond that, requiring our employees to hold themselves to the highest standard of personal and professional ethical behaviour. The Code of Conduct is approved by the Board of GrainCorp.Every employee in GrainCorp is required to complete Code of Conduct training at the commencement of their employment. The training is delivered via an online e-module, or in a face-to-face setting. The training program is administered by GrainCorp’s Learning & Development team and is part of a broader group of induction training modules.GrainCorp’s Code of Conduct is available on GrainCorp’s website:  graincorp.com.auSupplier Code of ConductWe released a supplier code of conduct in March 2021 that requires our suppliers to comply with legal requirements, industry standards and have systems in place to manage key ESG risks. The existing code is embedded in key legal contracts and provides solid foundations for responsible sourcing. The GrainCorp Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the standards and principles that we expect our suppliers (and a supplier’s direct suppliers) to adhere to when conducting business with GrainCorp. When suppliers do business with GrainCorp, and this code is part of our dealings, we expect them to: –Comply with all relevant and applicable laws and regulations in the countries within which they operate; – Endeavour to meet international and industry guidelines, standards and best practice; and – Implement systems, processes and controls to: –Protect the environment –Respect human rights –Prohibit modern slavery labour practices –Prohibit child labour –Ensure reasonable working hours and wages –Provide a safe working environment –Act lawfully and with integrity –Adequately manage grievancesThe Supplier Code of Conduct includes the right to investigate and audit a supplier’s conduct and compliance in certain circumstances. In the event that we identify, or are made aware of, an incidence of modern slavery practices or human rights violations, we will engage the supplier’s senior management to develop a remediation plan, or in serious cases, may suspend dealings.In FY22, we evaluated our code against industry best practice and identified improvement opportunities that have been incorporated into a new Supplier Code of Conduct. This review of best practice also identified the need to continue to grow internal capability regarding responsible sourcing as well as the need to develop a detailed supplier engagement plan, to roll out an enhanced supplier code of conduct and drive positive outcomes in our supply chain.Policy and Governance continued10GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTSupplier Due DiligenceFor the onboarding of new suppliers, GrainCorp has a risk-based due diligence approach to modern slavery risk that is aligned with our  Anti-Bribery & Corruption (ABC) procedures. Certain ‘Defined Risk Criteria’, including but not limited to source location and category of spend  (for example, freight services, packaging and ingredients), form the basis for determining the requirement for due diligence, under three categories – Simple Due Diligence, Regular Due Diligence and Heightened Due Diligence.Risk Identification, Mitigation and RemediationDuring the reporting period, GrainCorp continued to implement policies and update due diligence procedures to assist in addressing the modern slavery risks associated with our operations and supply chains. Palm Oil has been identified as our highest risk exposure to modern slavery risks due to the combination of geographic and industry/sector exposures. In FY22, GrainCorp has also focused attention on understanding our modern slavery risk exposure in the following industry/sectors risk factors outlined in the Identifying our Modern Slavery Risk section above: Ocean Freight, Variable Labour, and Clothing and Footwear.Palm OilGrainCorp purchases palm oil for use in GrainCorp products and in the products we produce on behalf of our customers. The palm oil industry uses unskilled migrant labour in regions that are high-risk areas for human rights violations.GrainCorp has been a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2013 and our three food processing sites (West Footscray and Numurkah in Australia, and East Tamaki in New Zealand) hold RSPO certification. GrainCorp only sources palm oil from RSPO certified suppliers. In addition, our palm oil suppliers are subject to heightened due diligence and regular monitoring, including through Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audits (SMETA).During FY22, GrainCorp: –embedded our expanded membership of Sedex and established a corporate structure within the system to allow for each part of our  business to connect with our suppliers.  –commenced connecting with our high-risk palm oil suppliers in the platform. –developed process for tracking SMETA results.Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil The RSPO is a not-for-profit organisation that develops and implements global standards for sustainable palm oil to help minimise the negative impact of palm oil cultivation. The RSPO has established principles and criteria to achieve desired outcomes, including principles targeting upholding human rights, and provision of safe and decent work. To achieve RSPO certification, compliance with all RSPO principles is required. More information regarding RSPO certification can be found at the RSP website: rspo.orgHeightened Due DiligenceRegular Due DiligenceGrainCorp  supplier universeSuppliers with risk factorsSuppliers with HIGH risk factorsSimple Due DiligenceDue Diligence and Risk Management2-1278-21-100-01Image: https://rspo.org11GRAINCORP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTOcean FreightInternational shipping providers are susceptible to labour rights violations due to a number of factors. Ocean freight workers are potentially sourced from vulnerable populations (e.g. from countries with poor track records on human rights). The involvement of multiple parties in the ocean freight contracts increases the risk of inconsistent labour standards and lack of oversight to ensure compliance with human rights obligations. Cost pressures or delivery timeframes potentially influence suppliers to compromise on their labour conditions. –InternationalAs a critical component in our integrated supply chain, GrainCorp uses third-party industry due diligence sources to vet counterparties, ship owners, ship managers and the shipping vessels themselves to mitigate operational, financial and ethical conduct risks. These checks enable GrainCorp to identify red flags indicating potential non-conformance with labour standards prior to engaging ships for the transport of our produce and products. In addition, GrainCorp seeks to engage only with vessels crewed by labour protected by industry accepted bargaining agreements. –Feeds, Fats and OilsGrainCorp enters contracts of affreightment for the carriage of animal fats and vegetable oils. At the time of contracting, GrainCorp undertakes due diligence as to the suitability of the vessel operator. All vessels chartered by the Feeds, Fats and Oils business operate in and out of Australia and New Zealand ports and are subject to Australian Maritime Safety Authority and Maritime New Zealand compliance monitoring procedures including adhering to the Maritime Labour Convention which sets out seafarers’ rights at work, including employment terms, health and safety, living and working conditions, access to medical care and social security.No material non-compliance events with ocean freight suppliers were identified during the reporting period.Variable LabourDuring peak harvest periods, GrainCorp engage variable labour to supplement the needs of the permanent workforce where we do not have an ongoing or fixed need for the labour. Most of our variable labour workforce is hired directly. However, where required, we also procure variable labour through preferred supplier third-party employment agencies and other agencies as required.GrainCorp has confirmed that our preferred third-party agencies have implemented modern slavery policies and risk management frameworks to identify and address modern slavery risk in their workforce.In FY23, GrainCorp will continue to engage with our preferred supplier, and other supplementary suppliers of variable labour, to better understand the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain and the effectiveness of the frameworks in managing those risks.Clothing and FootwearGrainCorp purchases industrial workwear and corporate uniforms through a preferred supplier. Our preferred supplier has an established Ethical Sourcing Policy and requires their suppliers (GrainCorp’s Tier-2 suppliers) to sign and agree to their Ethical Sourcing Policy. Where these Tier-2 suppliers have factories based in higher-risk jurisdictions, our preferred supplier requests ethical-trade audits to assess the risk of modern slavery in their supply chain.In FY23, GrainCorp will continue to engage with our preferred supplier, and other supplementary suppliers of clothing and footwear, to better understand the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain and the effectiveness of the frameworks in managing those risks.Due Diligence and Risk Management continuedTotal2,636FemaleMaleNon-Binary1,3411,2923812366445111458352111406348147Northern NSWSouthern NSWQLDVIC811258755Harvest casual workforce – snapshot11.
