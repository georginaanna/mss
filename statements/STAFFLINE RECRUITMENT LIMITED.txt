MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2021-2022The coronavirus (Covid-19) global pandemic has created a swathe of unprecedented scenarios for all companies and communities worldwide. It has left people vulnerable and facing hardships which in turn creates opportunities for exploitation and Modern Slavery. Staffline is at the forefront of recruitment and creating exciting new opportunities within employment, it is our responsibility and throughout our workers journey we aim to disrupt exploitation, tackle Modern Slavery, and maintain worker welfare at the heart of everything we do.At Staffline, we have a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking.

Registered office: 19 & 20 The Triangle, NG2 Business Park, Nottingham, NG2 1AE.  Company registration: 03996086 We recognised that in Covid-19 times, there was a clear danger of labour exploitation being hidden more than ever, especially following the closure of some businesses and exploiters looking for alternative sectors to infiltrate, so it was hugely important for us to remain vigilant. We may not have seen as many workers face to face as we would normally, but we kept as close as we could virtually to support them and report any concerning signs. Being business partners with the Stronger Together initiative and the Responsible Recruitment Toolkit has helped us keep the profile raised keeping it high on ethical agendas throughout our supply chain.  Our central compliance team has worked remotely throughout last year, except for our Investigators that have sometimes needed to attend our sites, in a safe and Covid secure environment following leads of potential labour exploitation.  In 2020, Staffline updated our Modern Slavery eLearning training and refreshed all our staff through new IT systems and our brand-new learning platform, accessible to all, instilling the importance of worker welfare right from our core.All of the Staffline teams, operationally out in the field, and centrally based in Nottingham, are all aware of the impacts of Modern Slavery on individuals, and are fully comfortable co-ordinating with the compliance team to report any concerns. It forms an integral part of our welcome day for all new team members beginning their careers with Staffline.Training & awareness3rightsequalityjusticemodern slaverycollaborationfreedomlawprotectionethicalcivilnationalinternationaldemocracycooperationhumanhumaneteamworkhonestyintegrityrelationshipsinclusioncomplianceintelligencenetworkCINCompliance Intelligence NetworkStaffline Recruitment Limited.

We feel humbled to be a small part of their work being in a position to be able to offer work placements to survivors to help them positively restart their lives.In 2020, it was great to work with the anti-slavery networks which build year on year and expand to more members from different organisations increasing their reach to so many that share the passion with Staffline to do our very best in helping spot and rescue potential victims of slavery. We continuously work closely with OnePay, an approved alternative payment solution for our workers, to ensure that any suspicions of Modern Slavery or other means of fraudulent usage of accounts are investigated swiftly and comprehensively.We are extremely proud that other organisations have used our workers’ rights leaflet to help spread the word and inform  more people to know their rights and understand more about what to expect from working in the UK. We are committed to launching new campaigns this year which we will happily share for others to use as a wider spread is more useful to get the messaging out to help more people.Working with our clients and those in their supply chains to raise awareness and keep the subject alive is a strong passion of ours and we welcome new conversations and building new relationships with all to do the right thing, and make a difference.The Compliance Intelligence Network that we started at the end of 2019, is  growing with more members wanting to join us to share high-level intelligence and help eradicate labour exploitation in the UK together. We look forward to seeing how many more will join us throughout this year.This has been a pivotal working collective which has, and continues to, develop clear communications, share knowledge, and best practice. With a team mindset and collaboration at the core to be stronger together in tackling Modern Slavery.Staffline Recruitment Limited.

New bespoke reports will be used, tweaked and changed to be fit for purpose to help us identify more potential victims of trafficking tracking throughout a worker’s journey, to identify potential signs of Modern Slavery.We check for any patterns with other workers details to look for signs of sharing, watch out for anomalies and trends along with and investigating any areas of concern, as our earliest opportunity.We use a variety of communication methods to deliver Modern Slavery and worker welfare strategies and monitor data to improve our operations and worker experience. Our staff and our workers are integral to our strategy to identify Modern Slavery, exploitation, and worker welfare concerns.Staffline Recruitment Limited.
