This statement covers all Cranswick entities:  • Cranswick plc • Cranswick Country Foods (Ballymena) • Cranswick Country Foods plc • White Rose Farms Limited • Katsouris Brothers Limited • Wold Farms Limited • Wayland Farms Limited • Crown Chicken Limited • Ramona’s Kitchen Limited • Cranswick Pet Products Limited • Cranswick Mediterranean Foods Limited  The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires businesses to state the actions they have taken during the financial year to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in their operations and supply chains. At Cranswick we are fully committed to playing our part in eradicating modern slavery.  Over the past 12 months we have continued to gain greater insight into risk and trends relating to modern slavery and made sure as many of our colleagues as possible are aware of these.  Brexit and the closure of the EU settlement scheme, has led to many workers being open to exploitation, without the right to work in the UK. These workers are not protected by employment law. Carrying out the correct right to work checks and being vigilant are key to not only ensure these individuals do not gain employment with Cranswick or our agency providers, but also to make sure these cases are highlighted with the respective bodies, to help protect individuals who could be exploited.  The Responsible Reporting Tool kit questionnaire and the SEDEX dashboard are used to track our progress and benchmark against other organisations.         SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT  Ref No. Version No. Release Date Author Approved by Review Date Tier Page MSW 9 01.04.2023 Miranda Spencer Adam Couch 01.04.2024 1 2  ABOUT US Cranswick was formed by farmers in the early 1970’s to produce pig feed. In 1988 the Board embarked on a strategy to broaden the base of the Group’s activities. Opportunities were sought to develop into related areas that added value to the Group’s processes. Activities have since been extended from this agricultural base into the food sector. Approximately 75% of the business’s revenue comes from the retail customers who are served from sixteen state of the art production facilities across the UK.   OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.  Included in our Human Rights policy and central to our strategy of tackling Modern Day slavery is our support of several internationally recognised declarations, standards and codes. These include: the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Global Compact, the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).  Breaches of our policies or allegations of labour abuse are taken extremely seriously. We provide an independent and confidential employee whistle blowing service that allows colleagues, both permanent and agency, to raise concerns.  We actively support the Employer Pays Principle that: ‘No worker should pay for a job’ – part of our comprehensive audit process is designed to make sure that any colleague either permanent or temporary, found to have paid for a job will have these costs paid back to them by Cranswick.  We continue to use the Stronger Together Human Rights Assessments to assess new and existing suppliers’ policies and practices on forced labour and slavery. Information received from suppliers should be checked and triangulated by competent staff. 10,914  300K          Ref No. Version No. Release Date Author Approved by Review Date Tier Page MSW 9 01.04.2023 Miranda Spencer Adam Couch 01.04.2024 1 3  RAISING AWARENESS AND AGENCY USAGE Raising awareness of modern slavery within our business is a vital step at Cranswick in ensuring all our colleagues, whether permanent or agency are aware of modern-day slavery and what to do if they suspect, witness or worst case are a victim of modern-day slavery. Identifying potential and actual cases requires colleagues to be aware and understand the drivers of modern slavery as well as the possible indicators.  Cranswick made the decision to reduce the reliance on agency workers and recruit our colleagues on a permanent contract, currently Cranswick are using 1.5% less agency compared to last year, equating to over 164 colleagues. The greatest risks of modern slavery exist for workers not in permanent employment and we will continue to offer full time contracts to our agency labour.  Agencies supplying labour into Cranswick are audited yearly, with electronic checks and interviews in place to help ensure there are no victims of modern slavery.  TRAINING To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff. All of our HR teams have attended the ‘Stronger Together- Tackling Modern Slavery in Supply Chains’ workshops and the Stronger Together data is shared across our sites and at induction in order that both our permanent and temporary labour is fully aware of our commitment to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our business, and along our supply chain. Group Technical Services, who manage our supply chain, have attended an Ethical Training Awareness session which included the ‘Stronger Together - Tackling Modern Slavery in Supply Chains’ information.  All employees and agency workers have access to our internal LMS system, Cranswick Core. This LMS has a variety of custom built and Cranswick specific courses from Mental Health awareness training, which is compulsory for all employees to complete, to compliance training such as Food Safety and Health and Safety. Courses can be accessed and completed in various languages.  In the year we trained 1316 Cranswick colleagues on modern day slavery, with a total of 3242 Cranswick colleagues now trained. We require all our labour providers to attend ‘Stronger Together’ training. All colleagues inducted at Cranswick are made aware of Stronger Together through the induction, meaning 12,000 colleagues have been introduced to this information.  In total across our online LMS system, over 69,000 courses were completed along with face-to-face training. The average training per employee was 12 hours.   Ref No. Version No. Release Date Author Approved by Review Date Tier Page MSW 9 01.04.2023 Miranda Spencer Adam Couch 01.04.2024 1 4  DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we monitor ethical standards across the business on a regular basis both internally and via external third-party audits. Sites undergo unannounced SEDEX members Ethical Trade Audits every other year and these are supported by our own annual Ethical verification audits. The business is an AB member of SEDEX and it is in our Technical Conditions of Supply that our suppliers register with SEDEX and make their Ethical data visible to us, enabling us to drive Ethical standards within our supply chain.          40.3 MILLION PEOPLE globally are in modern slavery, with 16 MILLION in the private sector  5.4 VICTIMS of modern slavery for every 1,000 people in the world  US $34 BILLION in illegal profits from forced labour in construction, manufacturing, mining and utilities  Average cost of exploitation, excluding domestic work, per victim is US $4,800   Source: International Labour Organization  OUR SUPPLY CHAINS Our Supply Chains Supply chain security and integrity is a crucial component of the business model. Robust technical and traceability systems ensure that our products are responsibly sourced from suppliers whose values are aligned with our own. As a company we use Labour Providers to supply a percentage of our workforce. Each Labour Provider is audited against our own Labour Provider audit standard by trained ethical auditors every 6 months. Within these audits, the ETI Base Code and controls around Modern Slavery are reviewed. We always monitor, assess and mitigate the potential risk areas in our supply chains and have robust systems in place to deal with such risks.  As of March 2023, we have 959 suppliers (both direct and indirect), with 100% of the direct suppliers (606) linked. 309 of 353 indirect suppliers are now linked to Cranswick via SEDEX (87.5%). Where indirect or commodity suppliers are not currently linked to Cranswick on SEDEX or registered on SEDEX, then we are working with them and aim to have them all on Sedex or equivalent by April 2025.  Where suppliers are not currently linked to Cranswick on SEDEX or registered on SEDEX, then they are required to complete our Ethical Questionnaire (based on the ETI Base Code) until they are registered. This activity is also supported by our Ethical Trading Policy, our CSR Policy, our Equal Opportunities, Harassment and Dignity at Work Policy, and our commitments to ensuring the safety of our employees.  We have suppliers in 50 countries across the world. These are mapped on the SEDEX database. This mapping process gives us the ability to search by low, medium, and high-risk suppliers. Using the Sedex data we can understand the Inherent Risks within the supply chain. The Mapping tool allows us to focus on suppliers within a Country, all the way down to a particular site.  Ref No. Version No. Release Date Author Approved by Review Date Tier Page MSW 9 01.04.2023 Miranda Spencer Adam Couch 01.04.2024 1 5      Ref No. Version No. Release Date Author Approved by Review Date Tier Page MSW 9 01.04.2023 Miranda Spencer Adam Couch 01.04.2024 1 6  The tool also allows Cranswick to monitor the gender makeup of the workforce and demographics, across all suppliers.   WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY The business also has a Whistleblowing Policy and a confidential, independently operated hotline for employees to voice any concerns that they have, and this can be run concurrently in line with site Grievance policies. The Whistleblowing Policy and hotline number is displayed at all sites to ensure that all employees and temporary workers have access to it.
