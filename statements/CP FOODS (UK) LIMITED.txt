Lockdowns and travel restrictions limited our ability to conduct on site physical assessments within our supply chains and often we had to find new ways to continue our due diligence with the use of virtual assessments, virtual training, and virtual capacity building. These new challenges further highlighted the importance of transparency and collaboration within our supply base and the necessity of obtaining good accurate data from our supply chains to mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking.  Through our collaboration with industry groups, this has enabled us to continue to raise awareness of Modern Slavery through a common approach identifying, addressing, and managing the risks of Human Rights abuses of workers in our businesses and our global supply chains.  OUR BUSINESS & SUPPLY CHAINS  Westbridge Food Group is a global business, supplying products to the leading retailers, manufacturers, and the foodservice sector.

We actively recognise the importance of our participation in combatting modern slavery in our business and supply chains and have specific polices setting out our requirements for our suppliers and operations to adhere to.  PREVENTING HIDDEN LABOUR EXPLOITATION POLICY  Our global sourcing principles on modern slavery have been strengthened by adding this policy, prohibiting the payment of direct or indirect illegal recruitment fees to secure a job. This policy outlines our commitment as a business to limit the risks of modern slavery.  ANTI-MODERN SLAVERY & ETHICAL TRADE POLICY  Based on the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base code which states that employment must be freely chosen, with no forced, bonded, or involuntary labour. All suppliers and subcontractors who are not already bound by ETI requirements through ETI or SEDEX Membership are required to adhere to this policy.  POLICIES PROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES:  • Recruitment and Selection Policy • Grievance Policy and Procedure • Whistleblowing Policy • Equal Opportunities Policy • Dignity at work Policy  The company whistleblowing line has been in operation for 5 years now aimed primarily for our workers in the UK to raise concerns for themselves and other colleagues. This will now be rolled out to all our employees in our global offices.  BUSINESS ETHICS  • Gifts & Hospitality Policy • Anti-bribery Policy  IN DEVELOPMENT  • Human Rights Policy, including Human Rights Due Diligence Assessment  • Supplier Code of Conduct  We appreciate that this area is complex and as our global supply chains increase, our continuous efforts will ensure that our policies are adapted to include all new high risk and medium risk suppliers. We remain working closely with our procurement and buying teams to raise awareness of our policies to ensure that suppliers are fully compliant.  Our commitment is to ensure that our policies are available to all employees at all sites through the most appropriate communication platforms and training is given to ensure awareness of the policies both internally and within our supply chains.  The policies above are available on request to carl.cooper@westbridgefoods.com    WESTBRIDGE FOOD GROUP LTD – Modern Slavery Statement 2021                  Page 5   RISK ASSESSMENT  Our due diligence process involves an annual assessment of all our suppliers. To determine the risk profile of each Tier 1 supplier we use several tools to ensure that the highest risks and impacts to the business are identified and an appropriate due diligence is put in place.   STEP 1  Our first step is to assess the risk of a supplier based on a combination of country risk and annual spend.  To understand the country risk, we use the Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET) risk assessment which combines published reports such as the Global Slavery Index, the US Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report and the ITUC Global Rights Index to give an overall risk rating by country.  Using this information along with the annual spend we plot our suppliers onto the following risk rating scoring system which will assign them each an initial Red (high), Amber (Medium) or Green (low) “RAG” rating which determines where, as a business, we focus our attention.                      RAG Rating requirements:    NEW SUPPLIERS All new suppliers must undergo the risk assessment prior to commencement of supply.          GREEN Annual Review AMBER Review Supplier Case by Case RED SEDEX, SMETA, 1 to 1 Support, 3rd Party Support HIGH(India, Bangladesh, China etc)336912MEDIUM(UK, Australia, Poland)22468LOW(Germany, Norway, Sweden etc.)112341234LOWMEDIUMLOWMEDIUMHIGHHIGH0-999910000 - 99999100000 - 9999991000000 +FNET Country  RiskAnnual SpendSTEP 2  Once our suppliers are given an initial RAG rating, a more in-depth assessment of those who are rated “Red” is carried out using the SEDEX Risk Assessment Tool “RADAR” to understand the industry specific inherent risks for the country of operation.  Using the SEDEX inherent risk rating combined with our initial rating our suppliers are further categorised with an overall RAG rating to determine where to concentrate our due diligence and help develop our plan for the following year. WESTBRIDGE FOOD GROUP LTD – Modern Slavery Statement 2021                  Page 6   DUE DILIGENCE  Having carried out a risk assessment on our supply chains, it is important this is followed by adequate due diligence to identify issues that may indicate modern slavery. We have extensive supply chains in high-risk countries, and this is where our efforts have been focussed.  We require all our Tier 1, Red rated (high risk) suppliers to be SEDEX members and complete the SEDEX SAQ at least annually, and to have a Semi-announced SMETA audit either bi-annually or annually as a minimum.        We recognise the importance of audits in providing a snapshot of working conditions in our supply chains but also understand the limitations they have in picking up hidden crimes such as Modern Slavery or Forced Labour.  Therefore, as we continue to use these audits, we strengthen their function by ensuring the audit data is reviewed alongside the output from worker interviews (carried out anonymously by a random selection of site personnel). Working closely with NGO’s they are able to offer additional worker interviews off site and in the community setting, away from the workplace.  Our anti-modern slavery and ethical trading policy requires suppliers to have an effective grievance mechanism in addition to a Whistleblowing or Labour hotline.  Where we see rising risks or new risks evolving in a particular market or industry, or if we believe certain risks might not be identified through audit, we would consider working with a third-party independent company to carry out further in-depth human rights due diligence review of that supply chain.  Where our upstream supply chains (e.g., Farms, Hatcheries, Feed Mills), have been identified as high-risk, we encourage additional third-party accreditation from reputable global certification scheme which cover the ethical treatment of staff and risks of modern slavery. For example, we source aquaculture products from supply chains certified to Best Agricultural Practice (BAP) and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC); we source the majority of our poultry products from supply chains certified to Lloyds Register Farm F1rst Welfare scheme which has a social compliance module.  We recognise that there will be risks and vulnerabilities in our supply chains and our efforts to identify, Act and Remedy will ensure we have sustainable ethical supply chains.  Through Audits, Assessments, Grievance Mechanisms and Whistle Blowing lines, any issues highlighted are reported in our KPI’s. In severe cases there is a framework in place to remedy vulnerable or at-risk workers, whether that be in the UK through local charities or GLAA, or in Asia through on the ground NGO’s such as Labor Rights Promotions Network (LPN).  WESTBRIDGE FOOD GROUP LTD – Modern Slavery Statement 2021                  Page 7   DUE DILIGENCE – CASE STUDIES  VIETNAMESE SHRIMP SUPPLY CHAIN HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Westbridge Food Group, in collaboration with key supply chain stakeholders, commissioned an independent Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) of our Vietnamese Shrimp Supply Chain to identify and assess the human rights impacts our business activities were having on workers in the Vietnamese shrimp industry.  The assessment covered the supply chain from finished product at the retailer back to processor, farm, hatchery, feed mill and fish meal processor. The assessment also covered recruitment processes, terms of employment and working conditions against 164 indicators reflecting benchmarks set by international human rights organisations through document review, interviews with site management and a total of 157 worker interviews.  The findings were mostly positive including all wages being above legal minimums, regular and not excessive working hours, and secure livelihoods for over 2,500 workers employed across the supply chain. The negative impacts identified were classified as minor with the recommendations being from the limitations of the assessment itself or the lack of documented policies and procedures which allowed for (though no evidence of) potential breaches in workers’ rights.  Following the publication of the final report an action plan was produced to address the recommendations and we have continued to support the outcomes and work with our supply chain to implement changes to better mitigate any risks of any human rights breaches.  A copy of the assessment report is available upon request   SEAFOOD TASK FORCE    Westbridge Foods continues to support the Seafood Task Force (STF) which aims to drive greater accountability and transparency to identify and eliminate human rights abuses and environmental degradation in the seafood supply chain.  During 2021, Our supply chains in Vietnam have made good progress during the year supporting the Country Expansion objectives of the STF with the aim of developing a single standard for shrimp supply in the Southeast Asia regions.  Our supply chains have supported pilot schemes throughout 2021 sharing current practices and trialling the STF tools to help build a benchmark and highlight any gaps in the verification process. During the pilot, training of the STF and its objectives took place at each stage of the supply chain after the mapping process which is used to identify the actors in the total supply chain including vessels.  This work will continue in 2022 with more physical assessment and projects being undertaken by the team.

As the world emerges from the pandemic and we understand the full impact of Brexit on labour availability in the UK; we need to ensure that we continue to develop and evolve the training and capacity building in our business and supply chains, as well as investing in industry collaborations which will enable and facilitate further improvements and impact.   This is a dynamic area for many businesses, and we continue to work with external stakeholders to ensure we reflect this changing environment in our planning.  The Company will continue to enhance our policies and practices to protect workers including encouraging further implementation of worker voice mechanisms throughout more of our supply chains. This will aid protection of worker rights and develop identification and remediation protocols.  Appreciating that the challenges of 2021 are expected to continue into 2022, our intention is to start the physical audit programmes of our suppliers when safe to do so with a plan to carry out more in-depth human rights impact assessments of our high-risk supply chains where we have less visibility.  This statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of Westbridge Foods Group Ltd and will be reviewed annually.
