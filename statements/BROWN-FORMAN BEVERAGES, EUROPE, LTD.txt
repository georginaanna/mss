Modern Slavery Act StatementFor the Fiscal Year ended April 30, 2022DocuSign Envelope ID: E56C41C1-4035-4F4C-B3E0-8EBC38A5F4E62What is Modern Slavery?Modern slavery is a violation of fundamental human rights, as it represents the deprivation of a person's liberty by another for the exploitative purpose of personal or commercial gain. Modern slavery can take various forms, including slavery, servitude, forced and bonded labor, and human trafficking. Modern slavery is prevalent across the globe. The International Labor Organization estimates that more than 25 million men, women and children are forced to work against their will. Global businesses have an important role to play in the prevention of modern slavery. By identifying high-risk activities and locations, as well as the common indicators of potential violations, businesses can implement processes designed to reduce the risk of individuals being unethically and unlawfully exploited as they seek to earn a living.  Brown-Forman’s CommitmentBrown-Forman is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships, complying with all applicable laws and regulations, and implementing effective controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place within our business operations or our supply chain. We expect the same commitment from our business partners, and we expect that they will in turn hold their employees, suppliers and subcontractors to these same high standards.Modern Slavery Act Statement  |  2022IntroductionFundamental PurposeBrown-Forman prioritizes the health, safety, respect and well-being of all people within our organization and across our operations, because people are fundamental to our corporate purpose of “Enriching Life.”DocuSign Envelope ID: E56C41C1-4035-4F4C-B3E0-8EBC38A5F4E63Modern Slavery Act Statement  |  2022Our Business170+Brown-Forman’s portfolio of brands are sold in more than 170 countries worldwide25+ We produce our brands and barrels from more than 25 facilities around the world5,200We employ approximately 5,200 people across more than 40 countriesBrown-Forman Beverages Europe, Ltd.

When assessing new business partners, we undertake risk-based due diligence prior to engagement. Once engaged, our suppliers and business partners are subject to continuous monitoring throughout the course of the relationship in order to systematically identify and mitigate against risk, including modern slavery risk. We use the Refinitiv World-Check Risk Intelligence system to surface negative media related to human rights violations in credible media sources globally. Partners and suppliers that are flagged in screening are investigated, and any deficiencies or violations identified are addressed.Recognizing that we do business in geographies where human rights risk may be elevated, we believe it is our responsibility as a company to identify high-risk activities and choose our business partners carefully.Point-of-Sale SupplierIn 2021, we consolidated the sourcing for the majority of our point-of-sale materials through a global provider who shares Brown-Forman’s commitments with respect to human rights and modern slavery.Our Human Rights StrategyFiscal 2022 marked the launch of our three-year human rights strategy to review and improve existing company commitments, policies, processes and practices. To date, we have completed a human rights risk assessment of global spend; formed a Human Rights Steering Committee chaired by our Chief Risk, Ethics, and Compliance Officer; updated our Global Human Rights Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct; and offered internal training to drive employee awareness of our commitment to human rights.
