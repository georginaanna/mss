J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/222A message from our Chief Executive OfficerDriven by our passion for food, together we serve and help every customer. As a responsible retailer, this includes doing what is right and fair for our colleagues, our customers, the communities we serve and everyone working within our supply chains.Last year we were proud to become a Principal Partner of COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It was clear to see that behind the pressing issues of climate change and protecting biodiversity are people whose livelihoods and jobs will face significant change and uncertainty in the transition to a net zero economy. The World Bank estimates that Covid-19, combined with inflationary pressures has pushed a further 85 million people into poverty in the last year, putting them at increased risk of forced labour. We have strong heritage in leading on Human Rights, however, given these broader challenges, it has never been more important to focus our efforts to prevent, detect and remedy modern slavery. That’s why our sustainability plan, Plan for Better, includes a strong focus on environmental and social action and we are committed to support a just transition as we adapt to the challenges of a changing climate. As a business, we stand against all forms of modern slavery and the exploitation of other people for personal or commercial gain. Human trafficking, forced labour, child labour and domestic servitude are abhorrent practices that still exist in many parts of the world, including the UK. We recognise that modern slavery doesn’t happen in a vacuum and an effective strategy for combatting modern slavery needs to be part of our broader human rights approach. That’s why this year we have undertaken a human rights saliency assessment to improve our understanding of the greatest risks faced to people across our business both in the UK and internationally.  This understanding enables us to focus resources where they are most needed to protect workers and we have published a report on the findings that can be found here. We plan to share more about our commitments later this year. We continuously review our performance as a business and look back at lessons learned from our previous work tackling modern slavery. This is our sixth statement on our efforts to be more transparent and prevent modern slavery in line with Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. The report details the steps taken during the year ending 5th March 2022* to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our own operations and supply chains.This statement has been approved by J Sainsbury plc Board of Directors.*Additional information is provided for activities in April 2022 in line with revised government reporting guidelines.Welcome from our CEO ContentsIntroduction  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .3Key activities in 2021/22  .....................................................3Our journey so far ...........................................................4About Sainsbury’s ...........................................................5Our approach  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .6Policies and commitments ...................................................6Governance .................................................................7Risk assessment and management ...........................................8Due diligence ..............................................................11Training ....................................................................12Key performance indicators .................................................14Effectiveness   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .17Sainsbury’s case studies ....................................................17Collaboration case studies ..................................................19Looking forward ............................................................21Collaboration overview ......................................................22Appendix - Collaboration overview  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .22Simon RobertsChief Executive Officer J Sainsbury plc20th July 2022 3J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/22IntroductionNew activities 2021/22The long-term effects of Covid-19 have become apparent this year, driving forward our commitment to support workers in our supply chains and build resilience into our business model. To do this, we have built on previous years’ work and extended how we think about human rights, including modern slavery, to go beyond the current situation and consider how climate change will impact workers as we head to net zero. To help us extend our thinking on human rights we have conducted a human rights saliency assessment across all our product areas. We have redeveloped our modern slavery training for colleagues and suppliers, giving clearer direction on what to do if they suspect modern slavery as well as how to spot the signs. We have also extended the reach of this training internally, making it mandatory for a larger proportion of colleagues in various areas of the business.    Within our Goods not for Resale division we have launched a new self-assessment programme with an online management system to ensure wider coverage of our GNFR supply base. The majority of our managed GNFR supplier base have been invited to the new system, covering 91% of our yearly spending.  Human Rights Saliency AssessmentThe pandemic and resultant shifts in working patterns globally has led us to review our approach to human rights to ensure that our approach is focussed in the right areas and sets us up toaddress future challenges. Whilst we have a strong history in supporting human rights, we acknowledge that the global landscape has changed significantly in the last two years. The World Bank estimates that Covid-19, combined with inflationary pressures, has pushed an estimated further 85 million people into poverty across the world. Against this context we recognise the need to continuously review our own approach to human rights as more people are at risk of being trafficked or experiencing modern slavery. We are also conscious that climate change presents a significant risk globally and we need to address the social implications of this as we move forward with our plans to achieve net zero and ensure a just and fair transition. To inform our renewed vision for our human rights work, we have undertaken a group-wide human rights saliency assessment across our product supply chains. We have conducted this assessment following UN Guiding Principles putting the focus on risk to people in our supply chains rather than the risk to our business. We also added a ‘just transition’ lens to our assessment to ensure we included future considerations around the impact of climate change on workers livelihoods and communities. One of the salient human rights risks we have identified through this work is forced labour. We can also see how forced labour fits into a much broader picture and understand the interdependencies between issues like discrimination, sustainable livelihoods, precarious work and how they intersect. We can most effectively tackle modern slavery by understanding the factors that enable it and then identifying the levers to change these situations.

It outlines our commitment to respect the human rights of everyone within our business and throughout our supply chain including colleagues, customers and suppliers. Sustainable Sourcing Policy for Goods for ResaleThe policy outlines our expectations for suppliers, including our Code of Conduct based on the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code. It also includes The Consumer Goods Forum’s Forced Labour Priority Industry Principles including ‘no worker should pay for a job’.Sustainable Sourcing Policy for Goods Not For Resale (GNFR) This is aligned with the above policy and applies to suppliers in our goods (and services) not for resale supply chain.Industry commitmentsWe continue our commitment to work with others to tackle modern slavery. This is a complex area that we cannot tackle alone so joint industry commitments form an important part of our approach. The Consumer Goods Forum’s Social Resolution on Forced Labour and Forced Labour Priority Industry Principles tackle three of the most problematic employment practices that can lead to forced labour.The British Retail Consortium’s Better Retail, Better World actions address global challenges highlighted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including modern slavery and decent work. All signatories commit to enhance employment and recruitment best practices and to embed a policy for the supply chain that no worker should pay for a job.The Retailer Protocol for Handling Reported Cases of Modern Slavery, which we inputted into, in partnership with retailers, the British Retail Consortium, Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and Stronger Together. We manage compliance with these policies, standards and commitments in the following ways:• Contractual terms and conditions include a clause on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015• Require suppliers to have their own codes of conduct, along with policies and systems to manage ethical trade in their own supply chains, report progress to us and allocate sufficient resources to do so• Provide guidance through a Supplier Handbook, Sainsbury’s and Argos Ethical Trade Manual for suppliers and our Colleague Handbook for colleaguesInternational Accord  In September 2021, we joined the International Accord on health and safety. This is an important move on from the 2013 and 2018 Bangladesh accords. This new agreement supports independent factory inspections by RSC (Readymade garment Sustainability Council) as well as looking into the feasibility of taking a similar approach in other sourcing locations. We do not tolerate any form of human rights abuse within our company or supply chains. We have well-developed policies and processes in place to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through our activities, including any form of slavery, and we are committed to addressing such impacts if they occur. These are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant and encompass best practice as it evolves.You can read our approach to human rights in our Human Rights report hereYou can read our Sustainable Sourcing Policy for Goods for Resale report hereJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2277Our approach777The Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CR&S) Committee oversees the governance of being a sustainable business, including modern slavery. The Committee’s principal role is to review the sustainability strategy, ensuring it is aligned with the company’s purpose, strategy, culture, vision and values. The Committee also plays a part in monitoring the business’s engagement with stakeholders including customers, suppliers, the community, colleagues, shareholders and government on sustainability and corporate responsibility matters.We are finalising our human rights strategy, and we will be setting targets and key performance indicators (KPIs) which are informed by a detailed saliency assessment. One of the most salient human risks identified through our assessment is the issue of forced labour and modern slavery. We will report on our human rights commitments and our progress to mitigate these issues annually. Angie Risley, Group HR Director, and member of our Operating Board is responsible for our human rights policy and strategy in our operations and supply chain. Our sustainability strategy, Plan for Better, is overseen by the CR&S Committee, which is chaired by Jo Harlow, one of our Non-Executive Directors.GovernanceReviews risks and confidence in disclosures aligned to the sustainability strategy1.Chair: Adrian Hennah, Non-Executive DirectorAudit Committee1 Remit of Commitee in relation to the sustainability strategy. For full details on the Commitees please read the Remuneration Committee Report and Audit Committee Report in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021/22. 2 Replaced the Net Zero Steering Committee as of June 2021. Steering Committee meets five times per year. Membership consists of Directors from across the business, with additional Director representation from Audit, Finance and Strategy attending the Committee twice a year to review Corporate Risk Updates including TCFD recommendations. 3 Current working group struture replaced individual pillar working group structure in September 2021. Working groups meet five times per year. Our Diversity & Inclusion and Skills & Opportunities pillars are managed via the Human Resources Leadership Team and the Community & Partnerships pillar is managed via the Marketing and Loyalty Division.This year, we introduced our new Social Working Group, whose focus is on human rights. The Social Working Group consists of senior leaders from across our business. The Social Working Group meets to discuss the biggest issues facing our business including the workforce disclosure initiative, our human rights commitments, how transparent we are as a business and the growing and emerging risks we face each year. When issues around modern slavery or human rights more broadly are identified in our supply chain, they are managed by our technical and commercial colleagues, and supported by our central team of social sustainability experts. The general merchandise and clothing business has dedicated ethical trade teams in the UK and all four of our sourcing offices in Asia, who have responsibility for the everyday management of ethical issues. Ethical issues are categorised by the level of seriousness and an action plan is put in place to ensure that the supplier reaches compliance within a set timeframe. Any issue deemed high risk or not resolved within the agreed timeframe is escalated to senior leadership.

Since its conception in 2017, this industry-leading tool has been providing us with insights across our complex global supply chain.The tool draws upon human rights risk data from Sedex, one of the world’s leading ethical trade membership organisations, as well as our own data about the manufacturing and production of our own-label productsWe have continued to enhance the level of detail within the tool, this year improving our risk matching across our categories and products. This is giving us industry-leading knowledge of our supply chain, particularly beyond Tier 1. Often, the production of the ingredients of our products are the riskiest and most challenging to identify in terms of human rights and modern slavery impacts. Having this level of visibility allows us to take targeted action where we see significant risks throughout our product supply chains.Using the tool, we can identify and ultimately mitigate human rights risks by engaging with our suppliers to collaborate on action within our supply chains that are most likely to be exposed to human rights risks, including modern slavery.Insights from the Human Rights Risk Assessment Tool were a key starting point in the human rights saliency assessment we conducted this year. Risk assessment and managementRaw materialsUsing our Human Rights Risk Assessment Tool, we have identified raw materials that present the highest risk of forced labour in our supply chains. The following maps show our activities across a few of these raw materials that are aimed at mitigating the risk of modern slavery. TeaExample sourcing countries: Kenya, Rwanda, MalawiWe will be continuing the work we started with Sainsbury’s Fairly Traded Tea via a new partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. This will allow us to collaborate on new and exciting projects and initiatives, enabling us to support the farmers we source our tea from, workers and communities into the future, whilst also seeing through the projects we’ve already made a commitment to. Find out more information about the Rainforest Alliance here.  Cocoa Example sourcing countries: Ghana, Ivory Coast, ColombiaWe are members of the World Cocoa Foundation and the Retailer Cocoa Collaboration to drive positive change on forest protection, sustainable production, farmer livelihoods, community engagement and social inclusion. Further information on our human rights approach can be found in our Human Rights report hereJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/229Bananas Example sourcing countries: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Cameroon, St Lucia, PanamaCoffeeExample sourcing countries: Colombia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, KenyaWe have sold 100% Fairtrade own-brand roast and ground coffee for over ten years and last year we invested almost $800,000 back into the coffee supply chain through the Fairtrade Premium which allows producers to invest in social, environmental or economic projects of their choice.In 2009, we set up the APECAFEQ sun-dried community coffee project in Quinchia, Riseralda in Colombia to enhance the positive impact of our trade. In 2021, we paid 2 cents per pound in addition to the Fairtrade Premium, which has financed sun drying houses, maintenance, and their coffee regeneration programme.All our bananas are Fairtrade certified. Fairtrade is about better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fairer terms of trade for farmers and workers in the Global South. FishExample sourcing countries: Thailand, IndonesiaWe are members of and contribute to several global sustainable fish initiatives, such as the Issara Institute and Sea Alliance. J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2210Manmade cellulosic fibresExample sourcing countries: Bangladesh, India, China,TurkeyOur MMCF policy aims to address associated manufacturing challenges and to ensure our suppliers protect the rights of indigenous peoples and rural communities where forest logging rights are allocated, or plantations developed. We worked closely with Changing Markets and Canopy to draft our policy and made it publicly available here. Through our traceability efforts, so far, we have identified that five of our direct suppliers account for 46 percent of the viscose tonnage in our supply chain and they source from either Aditya Birla Group or Lenzing AG. We know that at least 52 percent of our supply chain are sourcing from Canopy green shirt approved manufacturers. We are committed to continuing mapping our supply chain and aim to disclose more detail in future.CottonExample sourcing countries: Bangladesh, India We have committed to the Responsible Sourcing Network’s Cotton Pledges to not source from countries where there are ongoing concerns around the use of government sponsored forced and child labour and have updated our Cotton Policy to reflect these changes. We are aware of the recent communication from the Responsible Sourcing Network about the boycott of Uzbekistan cotton being over and will be taking a cautious approach to review our business policies and commitments. We also acknowledge the difficulties with cotton from the Xinjiang region in China and our policy outlines our focus on gaining greater traceability of our cotton sourcing.11In Sainsbury’s GM&C, we recognise the importance of giving our colleagues the tools to be able to do basic levels of due diligence when visiting our factories and highlighting areas of concern. This year, we have relaunched the Everyone’s Business application to all commercial and technical colleagues globally. The Everyone’s Business application is a web application that provides guidance and relevant information on responsible sourcing principles, sourcing countries’ local context, and how to spot potential issues at supplier sites. This information is then reviewed by the ethical experts in the country.We have joined a number of Sedex working groups including the SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire) project advisory group and the Service Provider Early Access group to support the development of new standards and tools to identify and manage responsible sourcing risks. TransparencyIn 2020, as a first step to improving transparency, the clothing and footwear business published a full list of 100 per cent of their Tier 1 clothing and footwear manufacturing sites. This provided details on sites, product type, worker numbers and location.In March 2020, we published our mapped and audited Tier 2 factories in Turkey, which is one of our biggest sourcing countries. In January 2022, the food business continued to increase supply chain visibility by publishing 100 per cent of Tier 1 food suppliers, including the type of product manufactured, the gender breakdown of workers at each site, and whether the facility has a trade union or an elected workers committee.We will be publishing our Tier 1 supplier list for general merchandise before the end of 2022. By March 2023, we aim to publish our Tier 1 supplier lists for the products we source within our GNFR supply chain.Publishing our supplier lists is just part of our wider efforts to build transparency and give the workers in our supply chains a voice. We also recognise the need for further transparency beyond Tier 1 suppliers and are working to achieve greater visibility of the challenges  faced further down the supply chain.J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/22Our approachSupplier monitoring and compliance We endorse the efforts of the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA) to enhance the professionalism, consistency, and credibility of independent social compliance audits. All new Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat supplier sites require a third-party ethical audit from an approved audit firm. They must meet our minimum requirements before we can place business with them. Existing food supplier sites are audited by approved third parties on a risk-assessed frequency based on their Sedex risk rating. We require that new sites share a social audit report within 12 months of onboarding. We monitor suppliers to close their non-conformances within the timeframes given by the audit bodies and support suppliers in addressing their issues.In GM&C, we ask all our suppliers to conduct an annual independent ethical audit. These audits are also conducted to SMETA (Sedex members ethical trade audit) guidelines i.e. against local law and the ETI base code.  We monitor these audits and support our suppliers to remediate any issues which have been found on site. All audit issues which have been found on site are categorised as Business Critical, Critical, Major or Minor, as defined by the SMETA methodology. This helps us prioritise and focus our efforts.We monitor suppliers through Sedex for food, and successfully transferred our clothing and general merchandise suppliers to Sedex last year. This means that we have one version of the truth across our supply base, with all audit data being recorded consistently, allowing our colleagues to more effectively monitor our suppliers’ improvement.We continue to work with our suppliers to improve their systems and share responsibility with them for labour issues in our supply chain. Through our dedicated specialists, we provide gap analysis against our requirements and identify continuous improvement opportunities that go beyond third-party audits, such as career progression for workers, enhanced management systems and worker voice mechanisms. We require suppliers to have policies and systems to manage ethical trade in their own supply chains. This requirement covers topics from how they manage their employees to how they recruit agency workers. Many suppliers have added identifying and eliminating modern slavery to their ethical strategies and activity.Due diligenceInformed by our risk assessments, we conduct due diligence across our own operations and supply chain, monitoring for indicators of any form of slavery or human trafficking and checking there are sufficient controls in place. A full list of our Food and Clothing Tier 1 manufacturing sites can be found here in the Plan for Better section of our website1497Totalaudits                     GM&C  1006870GM&C627FoodWe carried out 1497 audits in 2021/22:J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/22This year, we enhanced our interactive modern slavery training offer for our colleagues and suppliers. Working with the former Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Dame Sara Thornton, and Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart Hooper of Essex Police, our refreshed e-learning brings to life how modern slavery risks are rising globally and how it impacts our business and supply chains. The course is designed to help our colleagues and suppliers spot the signs of modern slavery, including the ILO’s 11 indicators of forced labour, and give them the know-how to report any concerns. Upskilling our colleagues As well as refreshing the content of our colleague training, this year we undertook a mapping exercise to identify colleagues whose roles could bring them into contact with modern slavery risks. In line with this mapping, we significantly expanded the number of colleagues who must complete the modern slavery training as mandatory, including colleagues across our stores and depots. This has resulted in a four-fold increase in the number of colleagues who completed the training, compared to last year. We encourage all our colleagues to complete this module even if it’s not mandatory for them, as we all have a responsibility to tackle this crime.As part of their induction plan, Food Technical and GM Asia colleagues have a mandatory training session on our ethical standards, policies, and processes, led by a member of our ethical team. We delivered further specific training to our ethical champions in collaboration with Stronger Together to tackle modern slavery in our supply chain (Stronger Together Tackling Modern Slavery through Supplier Site Visits and Stronger Together Investigative Interview skills in the Workplace).3,429 colleagues completed our internal Modern Slavery training this year, an increase of over 300 per cent.12TrainingCompared to last year: ‘‘Good and clear information, interactive exercises were useful in learning the details, would be accessible for others in the business as a good intro and overview“Informative and easy to follow. A great educational and training tool that I’ll be sharing with  my colleagues.Our approach300%more colleagues completed Modern Slavery trainingOverJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2213Our approachUpskilling our suppliers We have created a tailored supplier Modern Slavery training module and have made this training available to all of our Food suppliers through our dedicated supplier training platform. We encourage all our suppliers to complete this training, which has been designed to build knowledge on what modern slavery is, how to spot the signs and how to report any concerns. Through this rollout, 36 of our key food suppliers have completed the training.We issued online training to our suppliers this year in the form of an interactive document on Implementing our Ethical Strategy for food suppliers, and we issued a supplier e-learning on Modern Slavery.This year, 38 individuals from 33 suppliers completed our e-learning module on Implementing our Ethical Strategy and 48 individuals from 41 suppliers completed our Modern Slavery e-learning. We continue to partner with Stronger Together, a multi-stakeholder business-led initiative aiming to reduce modern slavery. Delivering specialist training in identifying and addressing modern slavery, this year reaching 386 supplier participants in the UK, 75 in South Africa and 7 in Spain.“Easy to follow and full of vital information to enable situations to be understood. The example scenarios were very helpful.14The following KPI’s tell us how effective the interventions and programmes we run are. They are essential to helping us understand the impact our work is having and where we may need to provide further focus. We will review these KPI’s in line with our revised human rights strategy that we will publish later this year. Non-conformances identified through third-party audits 49categorised under the ‘employment is freely chosen’ clause of our Supplier Code of Conduct. These are related to missing or inadequate policies, inappropriate monitoring of toilet breaks, compulsory overtime, and unreasonable recruitment fees.80categorised under ‘no harsh or inhumane treatment’ clause of our Supplier Code of Conduct. These related to opportunities to improve grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures, additional training required on these policies as well as instances of poor people management.  All were appropriately followed up and tracked to ensure the issues are remediated .These figures are taken from an impact assessment carried out by Stronger Together in 2021.

Training our colleaguesThis year, 3,429 colleagues completed our enhanced modern slavery e-learning module from across the business. Colleagues are encouraged to complete this module annually. In addition, 31 colleagues completed our ethical sourcing e-learning module this year across the business.This year, 6 colleagues attended the ‘Tackling Modern Slavery in UK Businesses’ workshop, delivered by Stronger Together. This included our Category Technical Managers across several categories, including Produce, Packaged & Speciality, and Beers, Wines & Spirits (BWS).Training our suppliersThis year, 38 individuals from 33 suppliers completed our e-learning module on Implementing our Ethical Strategy and 48 individuals from 41 suppliers completed our Modern Slavery e-learning.Respecting human rights through sustainable sourcing 100% of our fresh Scottish salmon range was independently certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). We are the first UK supermarket to have 100% of its fresh Scottish salmon range ASC certified100% of palm oil in our products is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard, which includes social criteria such as respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and respecting workers’ rights and conditions within palm oil plantations, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.77% of timber and paper-based products are sourced to independent sustainability standards, including international standards for environmental and social sustainability such as the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®), which states: “There is an extensive due diligence process to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not part of the production process of FSC®-certified products”.94% of the cotton for our clothing and general merchandise is sourced more sustainably through the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), up from 89 per cent in 2020/21. As well as water and pesticide savings, an estimated €4.4 million additional profit benefitted BCI farmers in 2021 thanks to our sourcing of Better Cotton. BCI Farmers experience profit increases for a variety of reasons, most commonly due to increased yields and/or optimised use of inputs (such as irrigation water, pesticides, or synthetic fertiliser).

The United Nations recognised this in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 8 calls for ’decent work for all’ and this goal also includes the eradication of forced labour. The Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) mobilises investors to push for better jobs. The first step is to make sure companies disclose comparable workforce information. Investors can then use this data to engage with companies and drive a race to the top. The WDI brings investors together to request comparable data from companies via an annual survey. Its ultimate goal is to improve the quality of jobs in multinational companies’ operations and supply chains. We have taken part in the WDI survey since its inception in 2017 and submitted responses for 2021 again.This year we improved our disclosure score to 92 per cent and were in the top 10 per cent of most complete responses.We were nominated for the overall WDI award and received special mentions for our disclosure on Workforce Action and Supply Chain Data. Our approachJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2217EffectivenessSainsbury’s case studiesActions in our own operationsGNFR Self-Assessment QuestionnaireSince last year, we have continued to accelerate and embed progress in managing ethical risks in our GNFR supply chain. This year, we brought in a professional vendor to support the rollout, verification and assessment of an enhanced supplier self-assessment questionnaire. This step-change in our approach was driven by our recognition of the risks within our GNFR supply chains and our need to understand these further.  We have invited suppliers to complete the questionnaire and will use this to understand their risk profile and what our next steps need to be. For new suppliers, we are asking them to complete the questionnaire/assessment as part of the onboarding process. Through our online system, we have invited the majority of our GNFR suppliers base to complete the questionnaire, representing 91 per cent of our yearly spend. This includes all our business-critical suppliers, and across our high-risk sectors for human rights issues. With our extensive coverage, we aim to use our suppliers’ responses to inform our future plans and strategy.We launched our enhanced supplier questionnaire in October 2021 and have prioritised our rollout within our business- critical and higher risk suppliers. In line with our contracting cycles, we expect to increase our coverage over the next two years as we continue our rollout across our existing supplier base and bring onboard new suppliers.  Where we identify risks as we roll out, we are taking action straight away to address these.In our food supply chainModern Slavery Intelligence NetworkSainsbury’s has been a member of the Modern Slavery Intelligence Network (MSIN), a pioneering non-profit collaboration in the UK food and agriculture sector created in response to the findings of Operation Fort, the UK’s largest ever modern slavery investigation, since it’s inception in 2020.MSIN is comprised of 14 member companies (including retailers, manufacturers and processors) currently engaged in an 18-month pilot to develop an innovative and proactive intelligence-sharing mechanism to enhance effectiveness in disrupting modern slavery and labour exploitation within the UK. Information generated by the network will be used to detect, prevent and disrupt modern slavery and labour exploitation activity in their industry sector, protecting workers and improving outcomes for those directly impacted. The project also benefits from the strong personal support of the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, who continues to highlight and champion the work of the MSIN.Throughout 2021, members have met regularly and engaged with external stakeholders, including NGOs, the ICO and law enforcement agencies, to share plans and seek guidance on the approach the MSIN should take in order to achieve successful outcomes. The MSIN has worked together to ensure, so far as possible, that robust mechanisms are in place to safeguard those who may be impacted by modern slavery and/or worker exploitation and their data. This has required a significant commitment from all members involved and engagement with several internal functions within the members’ organisations including human rights, ethical trading, legal, data protection, privacy and IT security.  J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2218EffectivenessWorker voiceIn 2021, we piloted a worker interview assessment to understand workers’ perspectives on their recruitment and employment journeys. We worked with a third party, Ulula, to roll out a remote survey across 21 of our factories across general merchandise and clothing. Following the success of this programme, we ran the second cycle of worker interviews in 18 of the factories to understand whether the improvements that had been implemented were reflected in the workers own experience. The direct worker feedback was conducted through interactive voice response (IVR) and web. This year, we used the support of Good Weave India Trust to support onsite deployment within 8 of these our factories. Good Weave India Trust is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established in India in 2012 to support businesses to achieve better working conditions for workers, environmental action and governance in their main factories and extended value chains.The results of the second cycle have been analysed and suppliers provided with individual reports. This analysis includes a breakdown of all the results with aggregations by gender and migration. We will continue to support our suppliers with action plans and will continue to monitor the improvement plans through worker engagement.    • 5, 082 responded to the second survey, an increase of 1,108 workers completing the survey• 8 on-site deployments with the support of Good Weave • 10 virtual deploymentsThe three areas identified as opportunities for the biggest improvement were anxiety and stress, freedom of movement and forced overtime. We will be sharing these results with our suppliers and supporting them to create action plans to enable them to make improvements in these areas. Over the next year, we will be looking to scale up our approach to worker engagement and will be deploying worker engagement tools in other high-risk countriesBetter Buying InstituteWe have subscribed to the Better Buying Institute, an initiative that examines the impact of purchasing practices on the financial, environmental, and social sustainability of suppliers. Through their assessment, we will better understand how our day-to-day practices internally are affecting our suppliers and, by extension, their workers, and the environment. Over the next year, we will be reviewing the questions to see how we can use the results to make more informed business decisions.18In our general merchandise and clothing supply chainJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2219Collaboration case studiesWe believe collective action is the only way to tackle global challenges at the speed and scale required. Here are some of our current collaborations. Leading with The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)Simon Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, continued in the role of Retailer Colleague Co-Sponsor for The Consumer Goods Forum’s Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative (SSCI) in our 2021/22 financial year, covering issues including human rights.We are active members on the steering committees for the CGF Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative (SSCI) to ensure that major social compliance schemes meet minimum customer requirements on issues such as forced labour and recruitment fees. With the overarching framework developed, this year we completed benchmarks for primary production and at-sea operations, as well as encouraging schemes to apply for benchmarking.CGF Human Rights CoalitionThe CGF officially launched the Human Rights Coalition (HRC) of action on Human Rights Day 2020. We are proud to be members of this coalition working to advance the CGF Forced Labour Resolution and its Priority Industry Principles in alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  We will drive individual and collective action in our businesses and supply chains to:• Implement Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) systems • Support responsible recruitment markets• Support a focused movement with all relevant stakeholders to jointly expedite the elimination of forced labourCoalition member commitments1. Establish and deploy HRDD systems in our own operations with the aim of reaching 100 per cent coverage by 2025.2. Activate pre-competitive practices (e.g. roundtable discussions and open-source training materials) to support responsible recruitment markets using the leverage of our own operations and collective engagement in selected geographies / commodities by 2025.3. Collaborate with selected suppliers starting with palm oil supply chains to develop and deploy HRDD systems from the refinery to the plantation level by 2023.4.

Support transparency and disclosure efforts on risks and challenges in addressing forced labour within own operations and associated with supply chains.ETI’s Gender Sensitive ProgramCommencing April 2022, we are supporting three of our factories through the ETI’s Gender Sensitive Program. The purpose of this initiative is to empower female garment workers within their factory workplace through increasing their knowledge and capacity to address gender-based harassment and violence and promote gender sensitivity at work. It is hoped that the gender programme will further enhance social dialogue mechanisms within the factory and contribute to strengthening industrial relations for sustainable development. Food Network for Ethical TradeWe continue to be active members of FNET which is a supplier-led initiative aiming to use the collective leverage of suppliers and retailers to bring about positive change in global food supply chain working conditions by providing guidance, resources, training, and opportunities for collaboration.This year, we have focussed on our efforts on responsible recruitment by taking part in working groups and contributing to the Common Principles for UK Seasonal Workers Scheme. The common principles set out best practice guidelines for suppliers recruiting seasonal workers.EffectivenessJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/22Responsible Car Wash SchemeWe’re proud of our commitment to addressing modern slavery in the car wash sector through our engagement with the Responsible Car Wash Scheme. We have engaged with industry stakeholders and other retailers to support the development of a national car wash accreditation scheme.Through the development and launch of a pilot in 2020, a not-for-profit accreditation scheme was created to promote compliance and raise standards in the car wash industry. The first hand car wash site was given accreditation in June 2021 as part of the licensing pilot. The Responsible Car Wash Scheme worked with the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and other regulatory bodies throughout the pilot, which provided valuable insights into embedding the protection of workers’ rights. Following the pilot, individual car wash sites can now receive RCWS accreditation, which strives to create improved conditions for workers; upholding their statutory rights and protecting them from exploitative work practices.We will continue to support the Responsible Car Wash Scheme to drive improvements across the industry and inform our car wash strategy. We will continue to implement improvements in car washes on our estates.Partnering with the Issara Institute in Southeast AsiaWe continue to partner with Issara Institute, to tackle forced labour and human trafficking in Southeast Asia, through worker voice, data, technology, partnership and innovation. In our Thailand supply chain, Issara is directly working with fourteen primary processing facilities and businesses in their upstream supply chain. In 2021, the long-term effects of Covid-19 have continued to impact direct in-person engagement with workers, so we have used digital channels to continue this important work. Issara’s independent worker voice channels are more active than ever with worker outreach and empowerment focusing more on digital communications and support through Issara’s independent helpline, Golden Dreams migrant worker app, closed Facebook chats as well as Line and Viber messaging. Building on previous research on the Myanmar-Thailand recruitment corridor, Issara continues to work with Sainsburys’ suppliers in its Ethical Recruitment programme. This brings together companies and their recruitment agencies to improve recruitment practices and reduce recruitment costs for jobseekers, working closely with local civil society to empower jobseekers and disrupt informal brokers in recruitment systems. The vast majority of foreign migrant workers in Sainsbury’s Thailand supply chain come from Myanmar. Our collaboration with Issara and their work with our suppliers enables over 29,000 workers to have access to Issara’s worker voice channels and remediation support for grievances raised, also helping suppliers to advance their internal capacity to handle grievances.  During the 2021/22 season there was a total of 18  worker reported violations, all of which have been resolved.  20Supplier ASupplier BLabour recruitmentProper, legal documents not provided to workerVery late or missing paymentsLabour issuesWorking conditionsEmployer-employeecommunications and relationsLabour recruitmentPayment systems and transparencyLiving and eating conditions633%844%16%211%16%Labour issues, by categoryEffectivenessJ Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2021/2221Section HeaderEffectivenessLooking forwardFollowing our human rights saliency assessment, we will be developing plans to implement these findings into our approach to modern slavery and broader human rights concerns in the next year. This assessment has given us focus on the key risks people in our supply chains face and where the highest risks are. We will be using that information to inform our approach and embedding this in ways of working across our teams to ensure the best possible human rights due diligence.Technical Change ProgrammeAs part of our Technical Change Programme, we are reviewing our direct and indirect supplier requirements as part of our Supplier Management project. Ethical performance will be built into a cross-functional balanced scorecard to risk assess our suppliers and influence our business decisions.
