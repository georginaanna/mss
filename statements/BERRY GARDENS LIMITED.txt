   1 Modern Slavery Statement 2022  BERRY GARDENS MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2021 ________________________________________________________  Introduction  As a business we are very aware of the constantly changing issue of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and how it affects all types of sectors and industries. We are very committed to operating our business in a transparent and responsible manner, striving to attain the highest ethical standards and respect for human rights. This includes reducing the risks of modern slavery throughout our business and our supply chain. We take a zero tolerance approach to the issue of any form of Modern Slavery and seek to ensure that all of our employees are observant of any suspicious or concerning activity that may be linked.  Organisational Structure and Supply Chains Berry Gardens is an international fruit marketing and distribution company, sourcing products globally.  We are a grower owned co-operative and this Statement covers both Berry Gardens Limited and Berry Gardens Growers Limited. We supply a broad range of customers in retail, food service and manufacturing. Our supply base is extensive and also has a global reach, some countries of which are considered of higher risk in respect of Modern Slavery. We work closely with our suppliers to mitigate these risks by taking a transparent, structured, aligned and sustainable approach to tackling Modern Slavery across the Company.  This is headed up by our HR and Technical teams and has the full support of our Management Team.  Policies on Modern Slavery  We fully support and respect human rights which is a fundamental belief of Berry Gardens and as such we do not engage or accept any forms of bonded, forced or child labour. We expect the businesses who work with us to follow these principles and will not knowingly work with those that do not. Further to the issue of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we have published our Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation Policy which provides clarity to all of our employees, agency workers and agency labour providers on the Company's standards, processes and actions that it commits to take in order to protect workers from the threat of labour exploitation. We encourage all our employees to report any concerns either internally or via our Whistleblowing Policy. This is widely publicised throughout the business.     2 Modern Slavery Statement 2022    External Partnerships As Modern Slavery is a global issue we collaborate with and support industry and global prevention bodies. We continue to have key partnerships with Stronger Together, in the UK and overseas together with the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. We have adopted their guidelines and use their resources in order to develop our principles in tackling Modern Slavery within our business.  Due Diligence Processes — Risk Assessment We risk assess our suppliers through the industry relevant bodies and operate to the Ethical Trading Initiative principles, seeking to support them to achieve the required standards.  In the next financial year we are committed to undertake the following activities:-   A review of our current supply chain to ensure the inclusion and raise awareness of the risk of Modern Slavery.  Raising awareness for all of our growers to become Business Partners of Stronger Together and to adopt their principles and embrace their resources.   Liaising with industry bodies to ensure compliance in labour standards and in particular Modern Slavery.  Labour Provider Audits will continue to be carried out with our GLAA licenced agency. Training and Raising Awareness We continually work to raise awareness among both our internal employees and our agency labour. We have used the Stronger Together resources in order to do this ensuring all workers are made aware during our induction process within their own language. During the induction we also hold a specific session in relation to Employee Rights. Throughout the business we display multi-language Stronger Together workplace posters in very prominent areas.  We are committed in the forthcoming year to reinforce training and hold regular workshops. Measuring Effectiveness We are currently looking at more comprehensive measurements to assess our effectiveness in the area of Modern Slavery.  Ensuring a 100% completion of training and understanding for all employees and agency workers is a key target.    3 Modern Slavery Statement 2022    Board Approval  This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Berry Gardens Modern Slavery Statement for the financial year ending 31st December 2021.
